# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

Problem Statement

Predict housing prices in Aimes Iowa by identifying the most effective predictors from the given housing dataset.

Executive Summary

This project is broken into two notebooks, the first notebook looks into Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning and Exploratory visualisations.

Business Recommendations

We found that Overall Quality rating of the property is most influential when determining price, followed by the above ground living area and garage size.

We found that Exterior quality had a bad rating, that affected the value of the home the most, then came the condition of the kitchen and basement.

We found that if the overall quality of the property, kitchen and exterior are above average or in good condition, properties of equal size would probably sell for more.
The neighborhoods that seem to command higher sale prices were Stone Brook, Northridge, Northridge Heights and Green hills.

If this model were applied to other cities, the ordinal columns that reflect the quality and condition of the property should be standardised and using a similar scale. The neighborhoods that are present in the features should be dropped as it would be irrelevant to modelling other cities. There might be differing preferences of local buyers depending on the weather and demographics of the city which will impact what is a 'desirable' property.
