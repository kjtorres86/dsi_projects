**We will continue to make updates to this post.**

# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Travel

If you have travel planned, read *[Coronavirus &amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel)* from Clark Howard.

Also see the [megathread on /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/) for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

2,t3_gfs268," Recently I saw my future income rising and decided to lock in a lease agreement to rent a nicer apartment. I was doing well in my job and a friend's small business I had been helping for many months was beginning to turn over enough revenue to create a side stream of income. 

However what ended up happening was sales began to slump at the end of last year and the amount I had earned from my main job began to decrease. The business I had been supporting was also put into a position where it could no longer pay me for the work I was doing to help keep it running.

All of a sudden the amount of money I was spending became more than the amount I was earning and I realized very quickly that I had made a mistake to increase the amount I was paying in rent. 

I began to feel very depressed and calculated that if I went on spending what I was currently spending with my new income I would be burning over $1000 dollars a month.

I was in a lease for 10 more months and it would cost me over $3000 to break lease early and many more associated costs if I was going to move out of my apartment. Uh OH! There was only one option. I had to REALLY tighten the belt if I was going to survive this storm I had entered into.

Using the spreadsheet I had used to figure out how much I was going to lose each month I went in deeper to understand not what I was spending all up but what I was spending individually. The big things were eating out, alcohol at bars and Ubers, and I also realized that I was spending about $40 a month on subscriptions too. I began to cut all of these things out, by cooking more at home and not eating out anymore. Not drinking at bars anymore and cancelling all my subscriptions and reading books from online instead. I also began to catch public transport or walk instead of taking Ubers.

In my first month I spent $500 less, The exercise has made me go through all my expenses and now I understand how much I spend on everything each month. When COVID hit it was like I was already adjusted! Since COVID I am now spending Over $750 a month LESS! When I think of spending for convenience I think about earning that money through not choosing that option. It is very helpful.

I also have become more confident and value money far more now. Now I know how much it costs for me to live each month. I know how long each dollar saved will support me if I lose my income entirely and see this as freedom! 

It has not been easy and I still feel depressed like today when I am worried about my future and not sleeping enough. But I wanted to write this post to remind myself of how much I’ve grown from the experience and that whatever happens it is just another opportunity for me to learn new skills and take more control and responsibility!

I have been humbled and when I am back fully on my feet again I will not take my money for granted. I will not let myself spend more than 20% of the money that goes above my new monthly cost number. The other 80% will be saved and invested in something to secure my future and help me become less frightened and scared. 

If you are going through hard times I hope you find a way to see the light and grow stronger and more confident as a result in a way that can be maintained long term!

3,t3_gf9bud,"I see pet ownership discussed here a good bit. As someone who loves animals, I understand the reasoning for wanting a pet. I also understand the work and funds it takes to appropriately take care of a pet. Here are the direct costs (6.75% tax included) that I paid from May 5th 2019 - May 5th 2020

Food/Treats:  $672

Vet/meds: $488 (everything routine outside of allergic reaction with bees)

Toys: $136

Boarding: $465

Air Conditioning Cord she chewed: $220

Pet insurance: $420

**Total: $2,401 or $200/mo**

I love my dog. She is an amazing companion, she is the protector of my wife and daughter when I am away, she is just an amazing animal. I am in a spot where I can afford to have and enjoy her. Some of these expenses will fluctuate over time, however when people say a dog is a car payment, they are right. Some years it'll be a used civic payment, other years it can be a new BMW payment or higher. Make a sound financial decision for you, your family, and the animal.

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/gf9bud/i_tracked_the_expenses_for_my_german_shepherd_dog/

I thought I would add some perspective with a longer term look at dog expenses. I've got a full image breakdown here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/G60VYi0)
And an image for the dog tax here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/Z372VAq)

Total Costs - $13,841.83
Notable Costs:  
 Vet Bills - $3705.15
   Food/Toys/Supplies - $4948.25
   Boarding/Kennels/Rover - $1863.59

Vet Bills: This includes surgery required right after we got her for a root canal. A couple of appointments for broken dew claws (she was a very active dog in her youth, still is :), and a visit to the dog ER for some major vomiting/diarrhea issues about a year ago. Other than that this is the cost of yearly checkups/shots and heartworm medication.

Food/Toys/Supplies: The majority of this is for food and frontline from Costco. I found that their food agrees with my dog and I can get a large bag of the blue buffalo knockoff stuff for $35. She needs about 1 bag of food a month. Frontline is also dirt cheap there at $35ish for a 6 month supply. This also includes some toys, and the price of a few dog beds. Usually a bed lasts about 2 years it seems in her kennel before she scratches it apart.

Boarding/Kennels/Rover: Costs to board her when she cant stay with friends/family. We usually take one big week long vacation a year where she gets boarded. Other than that its maybe 2-3 over nights a year on top of our vacation. Rover we also found to be cheaper/closer once we found someone in our neighborhood. The dog also seems to like it a lot more.

The rest of the expenses in the list are pretty rink-a-dink one off things. Random toys/treats, some training costs from when we first got her, the initial adoption cost. The cost for PetPlan was after I was spending a ton of money on her at the vet in the first year. I thought dog insurance would be worth the cost. I quickly learned that it isnt. They have loopholes big enough to drive a semi through, and I see no way to justify the expense unless you have a pure breed dog that you know for certain will have high vet costs.

Please feel free to ask any questions! I love tracking my expenses and personal finance. I think now we've got a pretty good handle on dog costs and what it cost per year/month.",5 Years Of Dog Expenses,r/personalfinance,0.75,13,1588974393.0,25,0

6,t3_gfgcol,"Due to COVID-19, my internship has recently been converted into a remote internship and I no longer needed to live in New York over the summer. I contacted my landlord about canceling my lease and she said that she could make special accommodations because of the pandemic. She offered to terminate my lease a month early, which means I would no longer be liable for 1 month's rent -- awesome. 

However, in the early termination contract she sent over, I noticed there was no mention of the security deposit. Wanting to be safe than sorry, I didn't sign the contract and instead emailed my landlord back a simple ""hey, when can I expect a refund of my security deposit?"" She says, ""sorry, we can only refund a portion of your deposit, and only if  someone re-rents the apartment for the month that you backed out of."" 

I was bummed. I'd be saving money by canceling one month's rent, but my security deposit was roughly equivalent to a month's worth of rent, so essentially I'd be back to square one. I thought that there might be a way out of this, so I dug up the original 43-page lease agreement and skimmed the contract until I found the clauses on early termination and the security deposit. I pointed out to my landlord that early termination was not outlined as a reason to withhold the security deposit. After 36 hours of no-response from her (she had been responding every 1-2 hours up until this point), she simply followed up with a new version of the early termination contract that stated I would receive my security deposit back and said ""Sorry for the miscommunication. You will get your security deposit back in full."" 

Boom! By talking to my landlord and reading the contract carefully, I saved myself almost $4500 in total (security deposit &amp; rent). Granted, I shouldn't have signed a lease for such an expensive apartment in the first place, but I'm really happy with the outcome.","Talk to your landlord, push your case, and always read the contract before you sign it!",r/personalfinance,0.92,216,1588918056.0,29,0

So I have recently been put on temporary secondment at a different department at the same company I work at. I had two weeks of training that were work from home and the role itself hasn't been TOO bad, but it's mainly been the people.

I don't know why, but the only person I really have jived well with are people on the same secondment from my old department and the managers of this department (which is all that should matter) but the other co-workers who are in this department already have been acting like complete stooges towards me.

I'm a relatively quiet guy, but I have been told by people from my old department that I'm pretty likable, easy going and have a good first impression, but I am being constantly berated by these people in my new department.

The houses we like are around $1 million but that is a very big number to me. I prefer to have money laying around to travel and stuff but I guess I should stop renting and start building equity?

I went through the hospital's appointment dept and they took all my information down and advised that my insurance was in network so we proceeded to set up appointments. Over the course of about a month and a half, I had a biopsy, several different doctor's appointments, CT scans, PET scans, and even surgery. I was never asked to pay anything other than my insurance co-pay at any of these appointments. After surgery, I found out that I had cancer and wanted to continue care at the same facility and was days away from starting chemotherapy before their billing department called and said I wasn't in network and would have to pay for all future appointments in full before being seen. I wasn't able to afford this at all and have since found care at another facility that actually does take my insurance. My question is, do I have any recourse to avoid paying the full 38k?

I was all set to move to CA before I started my new job and I gave my friend's address in CA as temporary address at new workplace because I did not have a permanent address in CA yet and did not want to miss out any important documents if the company sends me.

Now thanks to coronavirus, I'm still stuck in Illinois but I'm getting taxed as California resident with my friend's address.

I don't want to change the address at my workplace now to Illinois because I'm on Visa which was filed with CA as state I will be living in, updating Visa comes with unwarranted risks and also this is for a very short while as I will be moving to CA sooner or later.

Now if I end up staying in Illinois but continue to pay CA taxes for 1 more month or so, will that cause any issues? I don't mind paying higher California taxes, I just want to be compliant but also want to avoid a situation where I'm paying taxes for both states.

2) Paying tuition with a different cash back credit card and paying it off right away (within a month)

3) Pay my tuition with cash. 

Are there any cons to paying my tuition with my credit card? Is it better to just pay it with cash?

I'm a masters student, doing my thesis and graduating in July if all goes well, and I got lucky enough to land a paid internship for it (not that it pays much, but it IS something. Certainly doesn't cover cost of living)

I'm also lucky enough that I live with my parents, so aside from food out/hobbies, I do not have many expenses of my own.

However, I want to move out, so I've been considering that 50% of whatever comes into the account is untouchable (basically, an emergency fund/savings of sorts), and the other 50% is basically money I can afford to spend

Should I be putting a bigger % towards the savings/emergency fund part? Am I going overboard?

 My employer has been paying me and a few of my co-workers 50% of our usual wages since the lockdown. I should mention they skipped a weeks wages and still owe 2 weeks full wages (we are paid 2 weeks in arrears), which we are told we will get when this is over. The 50% is coming from company funds. We are told we will receive the extra 30% when they claim the money from the HMRC furlough scheme.
Our concern is our employer keeps telling us they have been having issues with furlough claims via the government's website and that they may not see the money until December. I find this hard to believe. I have found no evidence of others having issues with claims, my employer states it is due to us being hourly employees??? They have been dismissive and/or skeptical of the scheme from the moment it was announced.
We have had to sign contracts that state we will need to give 1 years notice if we decide to leave or repay all monies paid to us during the lockdown/furlough period.

For some context, I'm a 29 year old male living in NYC with no serious health issues (knock on wood). I am planning on getting LASIK eye surgery this year and that will cost $5500. I just recently learned that I can pay for this through an HSA, meaning I can pay with pre tax money. I've got a couple questions:

1. If I pay for LASIK with my HSA am I essentially saving an amount of money equal to my effective tax rate? For instance, if my total tax rate after federal, state, and city taxes is \~45% would I be saving 45% on my LASIK surgery by paying through the HSA?
2. On the benefits sheet is says my company will pay $41.66 into my HSA for an individual (which I am). What does this mean? Does this mean they will pay $41.66 into the HSA monthly? What if I don't end up spending that money? Does this count towards the yearly limit that you can contribute into an HSA?
3. It looks like the limit for an HSA is $3550. If my LASIK is $5500 can I split the payment over two years? Or if the $3550 yearly limit does not include employer contributions than I should be able to get the $5500 in a year.

53,t3_gfuf0b,"A popular discussion point on r/personalfinance is leveraging a job offer to get a raise at your current employer, but I need some advice in my current situation.

Preface: I work in an essential manufacturing business, so the current pandemic has not hit me as hard as others.  I have worked there a little longer than 2 1/2 years.  We are in our busy season, and we are currently running fairly smoothly (largely in part due to my contributions).  We expect to be profitable for the second quarter in a row.  However, I've been searching for a new opportunity to increase my compensation.  This has been a problem for my employer - we had 3 people in my team jump ship in the span of 5 weeks late last year due in part to compensation.  This lead to a surprise, mid-year raise of 8% to try to deter any more surprise departures.  

Despite this raise, I still felt I was not being properly compensated, thus my search.  About a month ago, I reached out to one of our equipment vendors inquiring about a job on a whim, and they were very fast to express mutual interest.  They expressed some concern regarding hiring me due to me coming directly from a customer.  Yesterday, I was verbally notified that they would offer me a job, given approval from my current employer (I would have to ask permission).  This job offer would carry a &gt;20% raise (when considering cost of living increase), and would also require a move from the Midwest to the East Coast.  I responded that I have to check on some things before 

The issue: in between the initial discussion and the verbal offer, my fiance was surprised with a job offer in our current area that compensated her more and would make her significantly happier (she is a teacher, fwiw).  We had set a deadline for me to find a new job so she could find a new job in the area. Long story short, the deadline passed, so she became open to local options and this surprise opportunity came up.  So, we are committed to the area for at least another year.  This means that the move to the prospective job will most definitely not be happening. I am ok with this since we had a plan/timeline going in (the long lag between initial discussion and verbal offer caused this).

My questions:  Is there any way to utilize this verbal job offer to my advantage with my current employer?  I have a good relationship with my direct manager, and I feel that I can be honest and frank with him.  My manager, as well as his boss, are aware that I am looking to advance my career.  They have said that opportunities should be coming soon, but I will believe it when I see it.  With that said, an empty threat of leaving during our busy season would definitely put a strain on things (bridge would probably be burned if I actually left).

* I also have RSUs currently totaling around $160k with vest dates spread across the next 2.5 years (the bulk of which will vest in 2021 and 2022). Though it's impossible to say for sure, I expect my employer to weather the pandemic better than most.
* I have 3500 in the stock market and am aiming to invest $100 every 2 days there, at least for the duration of shelter-in-place (this may cut back to 75 or so when my bonus payments end, but my RSU vests will increase at that point, which I plan to sell and diversify with ETFs).
* I have 1000 in an HSBC savings account (1.6 apy at the moment, just moved from wealthfront) and am aiming to invest $100 every 2 days there as well, during shelter in place
* As mentioned above I have no debt, student loans or otherwise
* 760 credit score

- Current Rent: $1165 until September 2020 (Early Lease Break Penalty is $2130)

- Emergency Fund saved up.
- Veteran. Pre-qualified with Veterans United for a $350K loan. Not putting anything down. 

- Looking for low $200s house in Central Florida. Definitely trying to keep payments below $1000. 

Concerns

- Florida got hit pretty bad with the quarantine. While I don't live in close proximity to the parks, I'd say all of Florida is somewhat dependant on the tourism revenue and that industry got hit pretty bad. I saw a chart that YOY revenue from tourism is down 70% and some articles predicting the parks won't open until 2021. 

- I got really bad buyer's remorse. I'd hate to get a property for X amount of dollars only to see a better one six months later for the same or less. 

Questions 

- Since my only concern is the price, I've been thinking about offering 10-20% below asking price (good luck finding that) so that my hit is not that bad once the housing market is affected by what's happening with COVID.

- Another plan I got is to wait. Maybe see some of the properties in the area I like (near work, within range of multiple charter schools, zoned for a great elementary school, beautiful community) sell and then hope that by September (when my lease is up) there's one for sale in that area.

My family and I moved to Toronto from Albania. We sold most of the land and a property we owned there which allowed us to set up a comfortable life in Canada. We still have 4 hectares of land there just outside the city called Lezhë which back in 2004 was valued at 120,000 EURO.

This family member is not a real estate agent. I will admit that the land is not really ideal for tourism developments or else I would've taken advantage of it myself. It is more of a farm land or land someone can build their home on. 

With that being said, what do you guys recommend?
 Try to contact a real estate agent to see if they can sell for us? Let it be for now and hope it goes up in value along with Albania's economy.

a) Salaried employee at 50/hr working 3 days a week and very possibly more as I would have to cover the other 2 supervisors if anything happens. Being salaried means I lose the option to get paid for overtime.

b) Responsible for the whole hospital and every nurse under me, including ER/med-surg/ICU/L&amp;D (would look good on resume but also add a lot more stress)

c) Would have to move and incur all moving costs + find a new apartment/place to live in a rural community with very limited options.

d) Washington is beautiful too, but would have to drive to get to the pretty places.

**Q: how much cash do we have to throw down to bump our LTV to 78%, and should we just toss that onto our next mortgage payment to secure that 78% threshold?**

* Original purchase price of home: $249,000
* Original loan value: $214,000 (i.e., we put down $35k)
* Remaining loan balance: $205,000
* Current ""Estimated value"" according to Chase's algorithm: $272,000.  Zillow says $280,000.  I put in a baller patio and outdoor shower, probably worth $10k, but I don't believe that qualifies as a ""significant improvement"" with regard to reappraisal value.

Check my math: $205,000 / $249,000 = 82% (does not qualify)

Or is it:  $204,000 / $272,000 =  75% (qualifies)

The reason I'm asking is that it doesn't look like Chase wants to help us figure this out (i.e., they just want to give us a Yes/No answer, rather than help us calculate how much more we'd need to pay down).

I’m aware of the pro and cons of paying off vs. investing money instead, but have decided paying off my house by age 40 (while still contributing 15% to retirement) makes sense in my case.

Here is my current dilemma: 

Given the current market volatility and uncertainty of the economy, instead of directly paying off the principle in monthly installments to the mortgage company, I’m thinking of putting the money in a high-yield 1.7%  savings account and then paying off the mortgage in one lump sum.

My strategy is this will give me access to the cash if something catastrophic happens (uncertainty of economy) while also earning a tiny bit of interest. And obviously, there’s no risk associated with a savings account.

Currently, I'm 24 years old and living in Boston. I make approx (subject to changes in bonuses) around 108k per year and this is my first full year of employment post graduation, as I started in July 2019. I plan on keeping this job for another two years or so before heading to graduate school for two/three years to get a dual masters.

I've always been a huge saver growing up and this has carried over to today as well. As such, I've already got approximately 15k saved in 401k/IRA and around 26k in my savings account. Given the recent global and economic turmoil, I've been looking for ways to add a second stream of income that would be low effort and long term. 

As such, I was looking into buying a rental property or two. 

I grew up in the Detroit area, have family there, and I know that real estate markets there are pretty undervalued (I think median home price is around 45k, with median rental price in the mid 800's) so I was thinking of:

A) Waiting another 3-4 months and buying a house debt free to rent

B) Waiting another 3-4 months and buying a house with a mortgage and a high down payment to have more equity/lower monthly mortgage costs.

C) Waiting another 3-4 months and buying two or three houses on mortgages, with a parent co-signing on one of them.

For all three of these options, I'd hire a property management firm to collect the rent, deal with the tenants and manage the properties so that I could essentially just coast. I'd be more than happy allocating the 10% fee that seems industry standard for these services.

So years and years ago, my mom helped me get a credit card through her credit union. We both forgot she was on the card (it's been about 10 years at this point).

Personally, I don't really care either way about keeping her on or removing her. She's the most trustworthy and financially-savvy person you can find. I just know, for example, creditors look at that kind of thing when applying for a loan (it was a negative factor when I went to get a car loan). 

The credit union says I need to reapply for the card if I get her removed. I don't have a long average length of credit lines. My biggest question is if this will negatively impact the length of my open accounts? Does it essentially close that one and open a new one? Does it really matter? 

I have a 770+ credit score, so I'm not really concerned about being unable to secure a solid line of credit after reapplying. I just don't want to see the score dip too much.

91,t3_gfpc9f,"Hey,

our current situation:
My dad died and I got 150K from his money. 
I work full time and earn nearly 2K / month.
I have savings of 30K in my pocket.
I live in my own big(ish) flat for 800€ / month + 100€ / month for mobile phone, internet, electiricy etc.

My gf:
Was in a 3 year education as nurse before she got pragnend.
She is in 2. month pregnent now but now allowed to finish her education because of that, but will get paid further for additional 6 month with 800€ / month, but has costs of 700€ / month for different things.

Our question:
With our child comming in early 2021 we think about getting her birthhouse from her mother.
The house is 40years old and dirty and it will need 4 to 5 month for her mother to move out and clean.
The house has a very big area behind the house within and is estimated to 220k to 250k worth all in all.
The house has 3 floors, 11 rooms etc.

The house would cost us 150K, with that money, the 3 other sibliings would get paid out (50K each) and a contract about that would be made by an laywer. We would have to spend around 50K to ""modernize"" the house.

So for me there are a few options:
1) Simple: don't get the house, stay in the nice flat, live here and grow the child here. 
Maybe, when a second child is comming, we need to find a better flat etc.

2) Buy the house with my money from my dad and invest all money I have in it.
So don't get debts in any way, spend all money we have now, make the rest later, be happy... 

3) Buy the house but let's split it between my Gf and me: be honest, we could split etc. So she should get 75K, maybe 100K and make 50/50 off all costs with me.
Her problem is: Where to get the money and how to pay the debt back?
As far as I read into mortgages she could get the money easy and pay it back e.g. for 30 years or something like that... 
But is that great? isnt it?

Of course getting into the house would save me 800€ / month but I would have to invest money into the house itself, but with a freshly modernized house not that much, I think?

A small addition: my small brother (19) got 150k too. He buyed a new car (HAHAHAHA) for 15K and spend 5K in party allready (in just 4 month) and he is looking for a way to invest the money savely. At the moment I try to explain him that buying bitcoins (as he like to) is not a brand good idea - he COULD make a lot of money, but he COULD loose much!

95,t3_gf8fhw,"Hello all,

I would like to eventually rent a place of my own, but also have the luxury to be in a nice place. I live in the Midwest. These apartments offer a in-unit Washer and Dryer. Monthly rent is $780 , including water,sewer,trash which is $35 a month. I get paid roughly 2500 gross income and bring back 1900 after taxes.

I do have one cat and monthly rental charge is an extra $25.00.

I will be paying for electricity that can round up to 70-100 a month. I do pay health insurance. No car payment( my car is paid off). Cellphone is 90 a month. Car Insurance is covered via other means that I am not paying for but still being covered. Health insurance is already included within the monthly 1900 paycheck along with 401K. Gas is cheap right now and estimating roughly 60 per month. I do not travel at all. I also have 2k of savings in case things go wrong.

With all this added, Utilities and food adds up roughly 300 a month. I also have no kids or a GF.

Just need an opinion to see if this is doable. Thank you.

I'm working with a small private practice as a full-time associate veterinarian, compensated on salary only. My employment agreement states the salary and expected hours for that level of compensation, including a raise schedule for the next 5 years.

Five weeks ago, my employer called me into their office to discuss some business related to COVID-19. They said a lot of nothing, ""everyone's bleeding right now, I won't be the only one bleeding"" and so on. Eventually they get to the point, they say after talking with their accountant they need to reduce the compensation of the veterinarians by 25% until the stay-at-home orders are lifted and business bounces back. They told me they still had to work out the details of that plan, but to expect in the coming weeks some sort of paycheck reduction to the tune of 25%. All I could say at the time was ""please let me know the details of the plan when it is finalized.""

I figured something like this was coming sooner or later, most of my friends work in the auto industry and this sort of thing happens relatively frequently for them. They've been dealing with massive layoffs and furloughs in so many varied, but meticulously detailed, ways for months now. Years even depending on which company and which quarterly goal may be coming up.

Two paychecks go by with no change, and I receive no details from my employer. Business has essentially tripled since then as well, so I foolishly figured things may have worked themselves out, especially with how often my employer was sure to mention that they were applying for the government relief programs.

This week my paycheck is short 25% on the nose. I have still received no communication about the details. I have spoken with one of my colleagues who spoke with my employer about this already, apparently their answer was that we are still expected to be working the same number of hours and that there is no plan to recoup the lost earnings for this period.

There are 5 other doctors in the group and the rest of us are currently observing a 24 hour ""cooldown."" I have seen more patients in the past 3 weeks and handled more emergency surgeries in those same weeks than I had in the 3 months prior, I counted. I have a very full day ahead of me tomorrow. I feel like I just got robbed 25% of my last paycheck and that was how I get to find out that my going rate until who knows when is now 25% less. No conversation about how to reduce my hours to meet that 25% goal, no plan to recoup, no notification in writing, no ""plan"" that I could either consent to or give my notice as declination. There are a litany of poor business practices that I have seen going on for the past year (and have continued into this depression), most of which I haven't criticised since I was still receiving the full terms of my agreement, and the one or two times I've spoken up I was met with the ""I've been in this business longer than you've been alive"" lecture. Now I feel like those things are my business.

Has anyone else dealt with this sort of scenario? I know everyone has something going on right now, but I'm sure there are much better ways to have gone about this.

Car insurance - $380/month

Cell phone plan - $150/month

109,t3_gfpodk,"Hey all,

So, the title basically says it all, but I'll get into more details below..

I have a steady job, it pays me a bit over 2.000€/month.

I have a car, that I bought using one of the secured bank loans (which is why the debt sky rocketed).

I also have my own apartment, that's rent free. I just used up all my savings and even took out some additional bank loans to make it happen. But it's now 100% mine, renovated, and completely rent free until the day I die.

My debt consists of solely secured bank loans. I have no credit card debt, no student loans, nothing.

The thing is, I have 2 of those loans, one at one bank, the other one at some other bank. I cannot ""add them up"" together to just pay it down at once, because total debt is higher than 40k, which means I cannot pay them with one single monthly payment, but I have to pay them separately. That puts me in a bit of a pickle, at least for now, because I have to pay one bank approx. 300€, and the other one about 450€. That quickly adds up to 750€, which is 1/3 of my net salary.

So, in theory, I don't have monthly car payments because I own the car 100%, I also don't have to pay the rent because the apartment is also 100% mine. After paying those 750€ a month, it leaves me with about 1.250€ that I use for basically food, housing, gas money, telephone bill,... stuff like that. Of course I don't spend it all, and I plan on building my savings again.

So, my question is the following... I just recently emptied my savings account because I needed the money for my apartment. I plan on starting to rebuild it again, starting next month. Should I save up towards paying off my debt, or just save up in case of ""rainy days"" ? Btw, my bank loans are already paid off automatically each month. But I was thinking maybe saving a couple of thousands until the end of the year, and then using that to pay down debt even quicker ? I'm not sure.

**I accidentally put too much in my 2019 traditional IRA (essentially overfunded) and went over the tax deductible traditional IRA contribution limit.** (the reason is b/c I have a 403 b account as well so I miscalculated my upper limit)

This happened just a few days ago and essentially have no earnings on the over funded amount, it's literally the same money I just placed in initially. I did not invest it in anything. **I still have not filed my 2019 Tax Return yet.**

2)  I was reading on a website that in this situation I should:

**""Withdraw the excess contribution and any income it has earned to avoid the 6% excise tax. You won't owe any additional tax on the contribution you've taken out, but you may owe federal income tax on the earnings and an additional 10% on the earnings if you are under age 59½. State taxes may also apply. ""**

3) This is the part I am confused about:

a) I am just trying to withdraw the excess money I accidentally put in originally a few days ago - there are no earnings. Therefore, I am assuming that I don't have to pay the ""federal income tax on the earnings and an additional 10% on the earnings if you are under age 59½"" as I do not have earnings? **Is this correct?**

b) **Also do I need to fill out the 5329 form  (specifically part 3)** [**https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf)  **in this situation still?**  My impression was if I submitted my 2019 tax return already with the over-funded amount, I would have to do an amendment to the tax return with a 5329 form. However, I haven't even submitted the my 2019 tax return and received no tax benefit at all with the over funded amount ( so I don't understand what I would be penalized for?). I am trying to solve the problem even before the 2019 tax return is submitted so I can just submit an accurate number with the tax.

He has around a little bit of money saved up, around 600$. I have about 2k saved up. On average, our monthly income can range 600-700$ a month each.

Thanks in advance to everyone for their advice. I'm not particularly financially savvy, so would appreciate the thoughts/suggestions of individuals on this board who have more of a background/interest in finance. I hope this post won't be a huge overlap with what most people ask on here.

In short, I am hoping to get advice about how to best save for a house/retirement.

Some important background:   Male, 33,  not married, living in Southern CA. Rent is $2100. Recently finished graduate school (PhD) and have no debt, but also little savings as I have been in school forever. Recently started first job about a year ago, currently making 130K.  Currently have 50K in a Roth IRA, which has already been maxed out for 2019/2020. My employer offers a 401K Roth with 6% matching, which I participate in (6%). I have a decent sized emergency fund.

Back to my question:  I am hoping to buy a house, probably in San Diego, in approximately 3-4 years.  By that point I'll probably be married, and we'll both be making around 150K. For the time being, i'm wondering what the smartest way to invest my additional income should be (given that I have maxed out my Roth and am matching my 401K). I wasn't sure if I should just open up a cash management account and invest in index funds, etc, for the next few years --- or if I should keep funneling any extra income into my 401K (technically I think I could put in another 10K this year), but my understanding is that it is not ideal to pull money out pre-retirement (e.g., for a downpayment for a house) from a 401K? Or other options?

So I've been lurking on r/personalfinance for a while, and I really value the insight I see shared within this community. Right now I'm considering purchasing a car, but I could use some of your input into this decision. 

In short, I'm a car enthusiast, and have been for most of my life. I currently have a classic car in my possession, but it has a major rust issue and was advised by friend with expertise not to invest in it any further, rather just find one in good shape. I began looking, and found a car that fit the bill perfectly, a 1971 Mercedes w108 in excellent condition for 12k. I really like the idea of having a vehicle that I don't have to outright restore and can take on road trips. Also, these old benzs of its body style are my absolute dream cars - I would ideally keep this car for life.

Here's my financial situation: I'm in my mid twenties and fairly early in my career with a couple years of experience. My job is stable with a big corporation and I make about 58k a year currently.  I anticipate my wage will continue to go significantly up in the coming years. My rent is $950 a month after all utilities, and my office is a ten minute walk from my place, meaning I don't need to drive much. If I do, I drive my daily sedan.

I don't have anything saved, and I'm 7k in credit card debt. I will have it paid off completely by the end of the year or (hopefully) earlier. This is likely what will push me to rent in the near-term while I save for a house.

151,t3_gfh0re,"Thank you in advance for any insight you can provide into this. I will do my best to to keep it brief.

I run a Graphic Design DBA. I have two unpaid invoices for ""Client A""  from January 17, 2020. I triple-checked deposits into my Business Checking &amp; Personal Checking accounts, and none of them lined-up to the specific payment amounts due (collectively and individually), just to be sure.

I gave notice to ""Client A"" that payment has not been received for these two invoices. ""Client A"" provided documents (Scanned Images of the Two Separate Checks for the respective amounts, from his Bank). Here's what the checks had on them:

* The correct $$ amount for each respective invoice
* February 3rd, 2020 as the date they were both written/cut
* My former address, where my best friend still lives (I moved in with girlfriend August 2019). He gives me prompt notice of any mail he still receives with my name on it. He has checked everything again for me, and has assured me that he NEVER received these checks addressed to me.
* On the back of both checks, there is a chicken scratch signature on the Endorsement line. It is NOT my signature, not even close. It is a very lazy, 2-short-scribbles, ""fake"" looking signature.
* On the back of both checks, the date ""02/06/20"" is written (not my handwriting). This indicates that the checks were cleared/deposited on that date (correct me if I'm wrong).  ""Client A"" corroborates that the payments cleared on that date from his end.

I went back to my bank records, triple-checked for these deposit amounts. Triple-checked for deposits on that date, February 6th. Nothing. No deposits on February 6th, nor within that entire week. No deposits for the specific amounts for either check, collectively or individually. I gave all of this information to my bank, and consulted with three different employees - each of whom ran checks on deposits into my business and personal accounts, cross-checking images of my other check deposits  with the images that ""Client A"" provided. Nothing. They advised that ""Client A"" call (we use same bank) to get further information.

I advised ""Client A"" of the situation, and to call the bank. ""Client A"" gets back to me, saying he spoke to the bank, and that ""They're going to investigate,  and they'll end up refunding me. I will write you two new checks."" For what it's worth -- I've received handfuls of checks for considerably higher amounts from ""Client A"", both before AND after this invoice. I have no reason to believe ""Client A"" is being dishonest in any of this.

So, all-in-all, I'm satisfied with the outcome of ""Sheesh, that's weird... Well, two new checks will be written soon."" -- But something STINKS to high-heaven in all of this. If the check was mailed to the wrong address, OK fine. That will explain why I didn't receive it. But... that doesn't explain how both checks made their way to the bank for deposit? And where were they deposited? Couldn't they figure that out, based on the routing #'s and account #'s on the Check Images that ""Client A"" provided? And Who's signature is that on the back of my check under the Endorse line? Let's say I deposited this check thru my bank's ATM/Drive-Thru -- At the end of the day, the bank manager goes through all ATM check deposits, and clears them... OK well -- do they sign it? Don't they just stamp it? Also -- if this check WAS stolen and falsely endorsed -- that's all it takes?? You can go into a bank with a check NOT addressed to you, chicken scratch on the back endorse line, and say ""Yah I'll take it in cash please?"" without any type of ID???

We're both big skiers and are currently living in Park City, Utah, paying $1650 a month for rent including utilities for our one bedroom apartment. With the Covid situation, I've lost my two jobs doing valet and coaching skiing, so we are both unemployed but have savings for at least the summer months. My Uncle just gave us the option to live in his second home, in South Lake Tahoe, NV, which also has great skiing, essentially rent-free either in November when our lease ends or sooner if we could somehow end the lease asap. We've been struggling to decide between taking his offer or renewing our lease here in Park City.

While saving the rent expense is obviously a huge benefit, there are a few negatives with going the Tahoe route. We would not have our own place, and would have to accommodate family / friends several times per year while they're vacationing and we'd be working. It is a 3-bedroom home and we also have a cat. We'd also have to buy a second vehicle, as the public transit in Park City allows us to share one car easily. Other negatives are that there are significantly fewer job opportunities for us in South Lake Tahoe than in Park City; we will both have business admin degrees within a year and my wife has a few years of retail management experience. At any moment (aside from Covid) there are several relevant jobs available here, while one may pop up in Tahoe every few weeks or so. Tahoe can be a little sleepy as well, while the skiing and general activities in Park City are a bit better for younger people (both in our 20s).

156,t3_gfmbl5,"**TL;DR: Feeling guilty about not saving for retirement or paying student loans. Can I ever retire or will my life be paying debts till I die?**

I'm turning 32 this year and I just started a budget at the beginning of May. My budget goal is to start saving for retirement aggressively. 

Last year, I made ~$22,000 gross income. I became eligible for the company 401k with 5% matching and contributed for a few months before stopping due to financial hardships. My current balance is ~$1,000, not including ~$500 from a loan I pay back each paycheck. I restarted contributing 5% this month. My investments are in a target fund.

I'm trying not to project my earnings and finances but I did get a 5% raise starting this month bringing me to $13.65/hr. There is also talk about wages going to $15 by the end of the year. I average 35 hours a week. I'm also starting a part-time job next week, starting at $14.50/hr with an average of 16 hours per month.

I opened a Fidelity Roth IRA and plan to contribute at least $200 a month until April 2021. I plan on investing it in their version of a target fund. I'm loosely following the prime directive so please educate me if I should be focusing my energies on something else.

Step 0: Budget is done, everything is as low as can be. I included my ira contributions and emergency fund in my monthly budget.

Step 1: My emergency fund is $0 but it is now budgeted for every month.

Step 2: Done!

Step 3: This is where I'm unsure. My debts are ~$35,000 federal student loans, in deferment. ~$10,500 auto loan @ 10% apr (literally the best and lowest I've ever had. Cosigned). I pay my auto payment every month. I haven't touched my school debt. It feels so overwhelming and I know it's growing every year I don't pay. I looked at the calculations and I honestly think it's going to take 25 years to pay back!

Should I stay my course with retirement or switch to paying back school loans? If it does take me 10+ years to pay back my student loans will I ever be able to retire? 


P.s. I'm also feeling worried about putting that $200 in retirement every month. I know it's a poverty mindset but now that I know I can save some money every month I want to keep it liquid in case I ever need it!","Budgeting for retirement, feeling guilty.",r/personalfinance,1.0,1,1588940877.0,12,0

I've been living in this apartment for 2 years with my husband and we're model tenants. We send our rent each month usually 2 weeks early (our rent is due on the 1st, and we send it on the 15th of the previous month) and have literally never been even 1 day late. We also rent the parking spot behind our house (literally our own driveway) for an extra $200/month - I understand this spot has a market value - since we live in an urban area - but we get no discount for renting both the apartment and the spot. 

We have no kids, no pets, and pre-quarantine we never have more than 8 or so people over, and we do that infrequently. We've had like 1 or 2 minor maintenance issues over the 2 years and neither were our fault.

So now he's trying to raise our rent $25/month and I just think it's really tacky. The economy is in shambles and there's no way they could get a tenant like us in this climate. I feel like he's trying to do it just because he can and I don't think it's cool. My husband thinks that this is normal and we should just sign, it's only $300/year so whatever.

I was hoping to get some information on applying for unemployment, mainly, if you can apply based on a job that just failed to start.

172,t3_gfieg6,"Hi all.

So I’m currently bringing in about $1580/biweekly after tax. Monthly expenses are about $1500. 

I have one credit card that carries a balance of about $1600 that I plan to pay off this month. 

I currently have student loans in my name that amount to about $33,100 that I’m paying $150 a month on and a Parent Plus loan that amounts to about $7,000 that is in my dad’s name, but I am paying it off myself and also pay $150 a month on. 

I’ve managed to save $13,000 over the last year or so that I’m trying to decide what to do with. 

Paying off the credit card, that leaves me with $11,400. 

My thought is to pay off the parent plus loan so that I can devote what I am paying toward that to my other student loans, essentially doubling my payment toward the larger loans.

176,t3_gflqn2,"Hi everyone and thanks in advance for answering. TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm 22F, graduated college recently, and come from a family that is struggling. My family was actually relatively well off/middle class when I was growing up, but my dad passed away suddenly two years ago, which put my mom in a financial mess. She found out that my dad wasn't paying into his life insurance policy (and had actually canceled it), and that he had a bunch of debt that she didn't know about. Now she's stuck with a mortgage that she barely makes enough to pay for due to debt. My mom is actually very financially responsible. She takes home about 2,600/mo after taxes and the mortgage is about 1,300/mo. My dad made more than her when he was alive, so paying the mortgage was no problem. But now she is responsible for the mortgage, property taxes, various insurances, utilities, other living expenses, and supporting my ill grandmother and my younger brother who is a freshman in college.

While I was in college I didn't need help from my parents because I had a job, internship, scholarships, and a small number of loans to support myself. However after my dad died there would still be some moments when I needed financial help due to unforeseen emergencies, and my mom was always extremely willing to help without expecting any payment back. At the time she told me that she had savings and was getting the money from there, but I've now found out that her savings had been depleted months ago and she is now about 18k in debt, not including the \~85k she still owes on the house.

I just got a job offer that will pay me a good income in a low COL area, so I know that I will now have enough disposable income to help her out. My mom has never asked me for money and I know that she doesn't expect it from me, but I have been home since the COVID-19 outbreak and have now seen first hand how much she's struggling (which she was hiding from me while I was away at college).

My dilemma is, I still have my own goals and priorities that I don't want to sacrifice in order to get my mom out of debt. I am aware that this sounds extremely selfish. I still want to save a 6-month emergency fund, live in a relatively nice apartment, save for a nice car, and enjoy my life while I'm young because I spent nearly all of the last four years as a broke college student. But I also feel guilty not giving my mom a good chunk of my disposable income knowing what she's going through.

I make about 5,500/mo after taxes and was planning on giving my mom about 500/mo while putting over 50% of my income into savings/investments, paying off student loan debt (30k), and living on the rest. I would like to give my mom more, but I don't want to sacrifice my goals. On the other hand, I don't want to see her struggle after she's sacrificed so much for me. Sorry that this has been very long-winded, I needed the cathartic release. I am curious to know what you all who have more life experience than me would do in my position. I know that interpersonal relationships are the most important, but money is important too.

TL;DR: My mom found herself in a lot of debt after my dad died and is putting herself in more debt to stay afloat.

I’m going to start this off by saying I used to be very dumb with money. I got a credit card at 18 and was in and out of debt until I was 23. At 23 my parents were very generous with their portion of inheritance and paid off my credit card and loan in full and I had to promise to not go into debt again. I’m VERY grateful for this as and I have upheld my part, which was easy because when I paid off the entirety of the credit card I found out it had been cancelled. This is my problem. My credit score is 526, which I know is shit. I was denied a credit card through my bank, but I was just approved for a secured credit card from capital one. I’ve been great the last year with saving my money and have been able to save $1000 a month. I’m really proud of how far I’ve come and how I know I can now be responsible with the money I earn but I need to boost my credit score. My boyfriend and I are looking to buy a house in the next four years and I’m afraid my credit score will make it hard on us. 

So, how can I boost my credit score quickly? I’ll be putting my TELUS and hydro on the capital one card and paying it off in full every month. 

I contemplated getting another loan from my old bank and letting it repay itself in my account without touching it (I switched banks when we got a joint account, but never closed mine with the credit union) and adding in a bit for interest. Would that help?

been scratchin my head the past few weeks comin up with all sorts of hypothetical plans. so basically, I hit 21 so sometime next year I need to move out, but I'm in the hole for $965 a month from student loans.

With my planned roomie, I estimate that my rent and utilities would be somewhere between 700-900, though ofc somewhere with 500 would make a lot of these problems moot with the extra cash. Probably 700

First off all my savings/investing goals are already met, so I won't have to worry about that for a long while, until hopefully I get enough raises and income increase to start it up again but Im thankful that my 8 year plan I was able to push those expenses out first and done in the past few years when I havent had to worry about things like rent or insurance, so its all about the day to day stuff atm  while that interest compounds and does its thing

I make 2k a month, but depending on how it goes I often get 2100 ish but not reliablely. Got an excellent credit if that matters

Anyways essential expenses

\- Student Loans 965 (across 3 different loans, 125 ish for one and then the other two split the rest)

\- Rent will probably be 700

\- Train pass for the month to get to work is 90

\- Car Insurance 150

\- Cell Phone bill 50

So as you can see things after all this would be nice and tight, but passable. But it'd leave me with little wiggle room, no extra cash to put into recurring investments, or walking around cash or smaller subscriptions like Adobe 

I need to move out next year, and without this student debt bill none of this would be a problem

So what should I do? Is there a way to dramatically lower student loan payments, since in the short term that would make things much more comfortable and I am confident in the long term I'd be able to catch up and pay it off well before the extended terms 

Get a side job or side hustle to increase income?

Its not the end of the world if I can't find wiggle room, and could even pump this lifestyle out but expenses would be too close for comfort and my main thing is that I'd want wiggle room to pump back into reccurring investments to stay on the track I've built

Moving out next year so rent is going to be the big one with student loans, with the smaller expenses piling up under them

Im having a discussion with a friend about leasing vs buying. Something very interesting is that I am starting to get convinced that leasing in his option might be the better option.

He is saying that he doesnt mind keeping a car more than 3 years but in his experience and driving style the car gets ""worn"" out during that period and also he doesnt wanna deal with upkeeping it. His argument is as follows:

If we look at a honda accord (25k price);

Lets say he gets a 3 year lease, with a payment of 200$/month. This means in 3 years he would spend 7,200$ and then return the car to the dealership. Compare this to buying a car in cash and selling it after 3 years. Do you think that the depreciation in price of the car will be far less than 7,200$ or close? If its within 1k-2k then it might be worth it to lease as there is less risk involved no?

I'm 35, I currently make $126k a year (total household income), married with 1 toddler. I'm maxing out 401k (I was just doing up to the match, but they no longer are doing match, so I bumped up my %) I'm maxing out both Roth IRA / wife's IRA and our HSA. The rest goes into a HYSA and I recently started dipping my toes into some stocks, but getting cold feet.

&amp;#x200B;

No debt other than house at 3.875% and car at 0%.

&amp;#x200B;

The job seems pretty safe (it's IT, but our customers are hurting a little right now, so business is holding cash). Not 100%, but I've been there a long time so I don't think I'd be the first to be let go.

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to move to a bigger house in a better school district, maybe keep the current house as an investment / rental (hopefully to friends / family), but we don't need to move. We're mostly keeping an eye on home prices since they seem too high in our area compared to what we paid 7 years ago. We'd be OK to stay put, but we'd be less comfortable if we had another kid and / or wanted to get into a better school district. Current mortgage is around $1,000 / mo, so trying to hold off and save until we really need to move.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing fine, but I guess the problem is I have too many different things up in the air and I don't know how to act in this volatile time. I'm terrified of making the wrong decision and losing money.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I currently have:

$150k in High Yield Savings

$72k in my 401k, which is just Vanguard 2050 target

$42k in Roth IRA, primarily invested in FXAIX, Fidelity's low-expense S&amp;P 500, and a small amount of individual stocks that seemed to have value, HPQ, DFS, MINI. but I'm starting to do some more Fidelity Freedom Index 2050 to have something more hands-free.

&amp;#x200B;

$30k in an inherited annuity. They said it's getting 3%, but I think it's actually 0.3% so I'm actively trying to cash this out.

&amp;#x200B;

$14k in Inherited IRA mostly MCK / GSK stocks with a little PRU and MSFT. All of those have been mostly OK for the last 15 years so I don't mess with them. I just added the MSFT earlier this year from some dividends that got collected.  


$15k in Inherited IRA with 100% ""American Funds Capital Income Builder"" which seems to be very conservative, and lately doesn't do much. Took a big hit this year, actually.

&amp;#x200B;

$11k in HSA, not invested in anything yet.

&amp;#x200B;

$15k in a taxable investment account, mostly split between VOO and some solid brands I like that should be OK long term, NKE, HD, AAPL, DIS, LUV (hopeful on this). I'm getting too nervous to pick stocks, so my plan is to increase VOO when I feel like there was a good dip (haven't in awhile)... so I guess I'm just too nervous to buy any stocks right now because I feel like the bottom might fall out again any day.

These are spread between Fidelity, Schwab, Edward Jones, TD Ameritrade,  Transamerica, and Ally Bank. Some of those I can't change (401k / HSA), and it's a little nuts having that many accounts... but I don't have any preference really so I haven't tried to move money around. I like not having one big number to look at anyway. Is there much advantage to consolidating?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to begin. Mostly, I know I have a long timeline for retirement.... and I think I'm doing OK there (am I?), but I'm very nervous to jump into the market with cash, especially right now. I might want to buy a $500k house, but maybe not... might lose my job, but probably not.

&amp;#x200B;

Having things all spread out there is annoying, but what are the things you would do first in my situation? I guess I'm naturally risk-averse, but I also hate the idea of losing money to inflation as well and not being able to retire until later. I'm sure that I should DCA stuff into a 3-tier fund and just call it, but I'm just convinced that these stock indexes can't sustain this growth considering the unprecedented halt to the economy I'm seeing around me.","I need some help sorting out my finances... where do I start, can you help?",r/personalfinance,0.81,3,1588910491.0,7,0

Well, luckily after the 3rd week my job called and asked me if i wanted to come in again. I, of course, jumped at the chance to make money.

Likely a rookie question here but something I don't understand and can't find the answer to easily. When contributing to a traditional IRA, you're doing it using post-tax money.

She makes 50k/year, I make 150k/year. However, my job is somewhat unique in that my salary is 60k/year, and I receive a 90k bonus at the end of the year. Also to complicate matters, my wife has been furloughed since mid March due to the corona virus and is currently receiving unemployment - no clue when or if she will go back to her job. 

When we filled out the IRS tool, with as much information as we can (being furloughed and receiving unemployment complicates some of the answers), it tells me I will likely owe $1400 in taxes at the end of the year. I have the desired refund set at zero and it says i will need 1264 witheld from each paycheck, $870 more than my current tax witholding. That seems quite high - last year we received a refund of \~3k and I only had \~$400 withheld in federal taxes from each paycheck(monthly). Also how do I need 1264 withheld from each check, if my current withholding status will result in only owing $1400 during tax time? That math doesn't seem to add up to me.

To further my confusion, when I download the pre filled w4 from the website, it simply has a $0 in column 3. Is that right? I just don't understand what is going on here. If it says I should withhold more, why does it simply put a zero in column 3? why wouldn't it give me a calculation for 4c (extra withholding)?

To summarize:

I just turned 23, I graduated 2 years ago. I’ve been working full time since then. I make 70,000 gross and around 45,000 after tax in a high cost of living area. 

I contribute 12% to my 401k plus 75% of my bonuses (only have about 6k in there right now). 

My expenses are about 55% of my income each month. I have no debt other than my car loan to pay off. I have 2 credit cards but pay them off monthly. 

I usually have around $1200 left each month after expenses, taxes, my 401k, and other needs that pop up. $500 goes straight to savings every month and the other $500 goes to subscriptions, entertainment, or other things I buy. I could probably be saving more. The remaining amount is piling up in my checking. 

I have about 12,000 in a regular savings account, which is about 8 months of expenses. 

We can’t buy a house within the next 6-8 years but would love to eventually. That’s my only big financial goal. No plans for kids.

Hi everyone, 
I’m 18 almost 19F and I’m debating wether or not I should take a loan to further my education.
I graduated high school 2 years ago and have since went straight into an accounting degree. I’m still a freshman because I absolutely hate it and was too afraid to stop. Recently, my parent agreed that I should really do what I want to do (art). And after research, I found that the most attractive formation for me is a visual arts bachelor. 
The problem is now that it costs money. My first 2 years were in a public university (I live in France) so it costs about 170€ a year. Whereas the bachelor costs around 7000€ a year. My father is willing to support me but I have 4 other brothers, 3 of which are still dependent on him, and he will retire in a few years anyway. We have a really good relationship, he is always there for me and helps and supports me financially and emotionally through my depression. And I don’t want to worsen the burden on him. 
So how can I gain independence and finance myself? Is a loan really necessary or a student job should pay enough? The school I found has a well planned schedule which allows students to get a job. And how do I go over that possibility with my father? (He doesn’t even want to consider not supporting me since I’m his only girl and little princess lol).

I (34M) currently have a 30 year fixed mortgage at 3.5%. My monthly spending is way below my take-home amount so all excess would go to different savings (I follow the flow chart rigorously).

===========Edit===========

u/MrPopoGod mentioned a very interesting exercise, so I did it and update with the results here.

Basic information: current mortgage balance: $650K with 3.5%. Monthly take-home pay is &gt; 5X of the mortgage payment, so all the difference would go to investments. When doing investment, we assume a 6% annual return.

Scenario I: investing the difference in mortgage payment for retirement, 30 years down the road. Keep 30 years = investing $1500/mo for 30 years. Switch to 15 years = investing $4600ish for the last 15 years. Even with a 2.5% 15-year mortgage, keeping the current load will still result in more retirement savings.

The more interesting one, however, is scenario II: if we would like to change to another house in 5\~8 years, which mortgage will be the best to reduce debt so we are better positioned?

I did a lot of different simulations, but if we switched to a 15-year mortgage with 2.5% interest, by paying $1400 more each year, in 8 years the debt would reduce from $650K to $330K. Instead, if we keep the mortgage and invest the $1400, in 8 years the debt would be at $535K with $173K investment. If we move to another house at that point, we would end up with 10% more debt.

Ok, smart people of PF, I need help in deciding which bank to focus on attn on. 

Here’s the back story: I have a mortgage with a local CU and recently opened a HELOC with them as well. The servicer for my mortgage loan is DM. My direct deposit and savings is with Chase.

I have been paying my mortgage to DM through Chase Bill Pay with 0 issues. I had to make my first payment on the HELOC and I set it up just as I did my mortgage payment (using Chase Bill Pay to DM and using the loan number for the HELOC). Turns out the servicer of the mortgage loan is the CU itself and not DM. So for a week now, I have been talking to Chase/CU/DM. CU/DM can’t find my payment despite Chase proving me with trace number, date it was accepted, etc. Chase cannot cancel it because it was accepted and processed and not fraudulent and not returned to them. CU can’t find it in their system because it went to DM. DM can’t find it because it was meant for a loan that is not theirs. 

I have spoken, nicely, to over a dozen people on the phone and messaging systems this week. No one can help me and points to the other party. Help me: which bank do I focus my attn on? A trace number does not seem to be enough to actually trace my payment, so what else can I ask Chase to provide as evidence that I made a payment?

I don't necessarily do a lot of banking in person but the ability to withdrawal a lot of cash quickly (in case of emergencies) is important to me. This is what is preventing me from going all in on online banking. 

Here is the plan I propose. Maintain the minimum $1500 to waive the monthly fee for Citi checking and open a CapitalOne Checking for all of my basic banking. The pro would be that since I have my savings with CapitalOne already, it would be easier to transfer money quickly. 

I do have another question. Are there any consequences of closing my citi checking account (my first and only)? Can I still maintain my three Citi credit card accounts without having my checking with citi?

Love to hear what your thoughts are! Thanks in advance.",Retail vs Online Checking? Thinking about leaving Citi,r/personalfinance,0.5,0,1588920364.0,1,0
256,t3_gfco5x,"Hi pf!

For the last year and a half I have been working part-time as a rural carrier associate with the USPS. If you didn't already know, rural carriers often drive their own vehicles to deliver the mail. Lots of people go for RHD Jeeps (which are out of production), imported asian cars, conversion kits in regular cars, or just plain straddling the console and operating one-handed.

My union contract stipulates that I have to have access to a vehicle I can deliver out of, but I have managed to get away without one. I am very very lucky to work at an office where 7/10 routes have vehicles provided, so I don't need to use my own car at all. My boss has been very accommodating as well; none of my part-time coworkers have delivery-ready cars either. Having my own car would allow me to work more and would put me ahead of my vehicle-less coworkers. Currently, if we NEED someone with their own car, my boss gets people from other offices to come to ours. So there are plenty of occasions where having a car would grant me more work.

I'v got $11k in my savings and $10k in my Roth IRA, and after looking around for months, I've narrowed it down to three options:

* 1994 Mitsubishi RVR -- $9,999 -- 45k miles -- imported from Japan and RHD
* 2012 Subaru Outback -- $13,999 -- 80k miles -- left-hand drive, so I would need either a conversion kit (\~$1500) or to straddle it, which can be dangerous
* zero car -- $0 -- keep riding my boss's good graces until she threatens to fire me

My biggest concern is financing. I guess nobody will give you a loan for a car that's more than twenty years old, so I would need to pay in cash for the Mitsubishi. I want to buy a house one day (maybe five years from now) and wiping out my savings isn't really going to help with that.

I could definitely get a car loan for the Subaru but my parents are CONVINCED that I will get into an accident while straddling and crush my pelvis/die/be rendered vegetative. Conversion kits are also hard to come by any more. It seems that they're only designed for a few older styles of cars, or entirely custom-made, which is not cheap.

Thirdly, I could just not buy a car. I don't know how long my boss will be okay with that though. It's been nearly two years and now she's starting to show me used car websites during breaks lol

My monthly expenses are:

* Income: $1800-$2500
* no rent or utilities because I live at home
* Student loans: $500 (minimum $200)
* IRA: $500
* Phone: $35
* Car maintenance and gas: $160 (dad does maintenance and pays insurance, I pay him a ""fee"" to use the car)
* Pets: $200
* Savings: $200
* Subscriptions: $35

259,t3_gfgrh8,"Hi there,

I'm 17 and from Canada and will be heading into university next year. I have been trying to plan financially, but I'm not getting any help from my parents - like not even the money my parents would usually spend to feed me, clothe me, etc. I'm currently not on speaking terms with them so I'm not going to be able to ask them for any help next year. I know that this will be difficult and I will be accruing a lot of debt, but attending university is what I need to do for the career I want. 

So I'm trying to budget, but I have no idea how much things should cost. According to my schools website, my tuition, meal plan, books and residence fee will end up being $20,429. However, I know that this is not all the money I will need to spend to eat, live etc. How much money should I be budgeting per year? Is $35k too little? Too much? How much should I estimate I will be spending on other things? I have been trying to start a budget but I really don't know how much money I should spend on certain things - what are some ballpark numbers for things like clothes, lifestyle, food, etc? Where can I find resources that will help me create a budget?

I plan to work part time, assuming I can get a job once I move to the city I will study in. I can also get $15,400 of OSAP (government) money - $8500 in grants, and $6900 in loans. I will also be getting a small $2500 scholarship from the school I'm going to. I have applied for bursaries from the school I will attend, but I haven't heard back yet. To fill in the gaps, I will need to take out other loans. Is a student line of credit my best option? What else should I consider?

My next question is - once I've graduated, how does paying back my loans work? How much interest will they accrue? How much of my yearly income should I be putting towards loans? And after that, how much of my life will I spend paying back these loans? Is this going to greatly affect my quality of life? Will I be able to save money while I repay loans?

263,t3_gfghz4,"Hello!

Wife has a new job that allows for mega backdoor Roth and we want to properly take advantage of the tax benefits. 401k and Roth IRA are both with Vanguard.

Plan details: 

* Allows for after tax contributions 
* Allows for in-service withdraws
* Allows for in-plan Roth conversions (401k after tax --&gt; 401k Roth)

She has done two withdraws from the after-tax 401k to her Roth IRA. The process can’t be automated and requires a call in each time (30+ min call).

Vanguard mentioned the in-plan Roth conversion that can easily be done via the website requiring her to not have to call in to effectively do to the mega backdoor Roth. They also mentioned that the plan offers the ability to withdraw the Roth 401k and roll it into the Roth IRA at any time. Sounds like the plan allows for in-service Roth 401k rollovers into Roth IRA.

Questions: 

* What are the downsides of going to the in-plan Roth conversion vs. withdrawing to her Roth IRA?
* If she does in-plan Roth and down the road rolls it into her Roth IRA she can withdraw the principal before 59, right? 
* Any major reason reason why she should go directly to the Roth IRA instead of her Roth 401k?

Note: 

* We are maxing out our 401k, IRA, and have a vanguard taxable brokerage account we are heavily contributing to.
* She has and plans to put any gains in the Roth and pay taxes this tax year to keep things simple.
* Her Roth 401k plan offers the plenty of interments at a low cost. No need for the broader Roth IRA options.
* Understand the basics of mega backdoor Roth (limits, employer contributions, etc.).

265,t3_gfghhj,"Background: The building is paid off. Cars are paid off. Own a Mix-Use building. The building consists of two apartments (2BD/1BA each) and one commercial space. Commercial space is being rented out to a dispensary at $8.5k a month with an annual \*\*% increase in rent. Commercial space pays half of the property tax. The contract is a 5-year term with options to increase it to 10 at the end of renewal. There have been talks about renewing it to 10 years as the 5-year term is almost up (guaranteed if we agree). Space occupied by the business is maintained by them exclusively. We still currently receive income from the dispensary.

The two apartments can be rented out for roughly $3k-$3.5k each. Parents work in construction so maintenance will be on them when issues arise in the apartments. 

Dad will have a job again once this is all over. The employer just needs to do a background and once it's cleared, he will be hired earning roughly $55k a year. He's got at least $150k in the bank followed by plenty in stocks. Mom receives cash for her work.

Monthly expenses are low as there is no maintenance cost since the dispensary pays for it. There is just the usual grocery, water, electricity, gas, and insurance (auto/home).

Issue: Parents are trying to get a mortgage loan (Around $800k-1mil) but banks are denying the application due to the fact that their income relies on the dispensary and marijuana is still illegal federally. Is this all there is to it? Or is there something else the bank is not telling us? Any other way to get a loan from the banks or even credit unions?

267,t3_gey79s,"Basically, I’m $30,000 in debt. I’m 30 years old and I’ve always been financially responsible; I paid off all my student loans ($20kish) in less than two years after I graduated college.  Sadly, life comes at you fast, and I now find myself $30k deep in credit card deep and unemployed. I’ve been unemployed since January, in fact, and I stopped paying most credit cards in December, so they’re all currently in various collection agencies. 

Thankfully, the new CARES act has really helped me get my head above water; since I’ve been unemployed, I moved back with my parents, and thanks to COVID, my expenses are basically null since I don't go out. This means that I’m saving about $4000/month clean, straight into my checking account. I currently have $8,000 saved up. And I expect to stay with my parents until August, minimizing my costs to basically nothing and saving up all my money, so I expect to have about $20k when I move back out of my parents house and begin to get back up and running. 

I haven’t been taking the calls from collectors simply because I’m unemployed and trying to save; there is nothing I can offer them. However, I do plan to pay back my debts aggressively. I called one collection agency, and they gave me two options: 1) pay back my debt with one lump payment “settlement” for which their criteria was basically ""how much can you pay?"" or 2) pay back my outstanding balance with monthly payments within 24 months. 

However, I’ve read through the internet (and this subreddit, there is a trove of info here!) enough to know that the terms I get offered are pretty arbitrary and subject to change since they pay pennies on the dollar for this debt originally. Please keep in mind that I can’t pay off all of this debt at once, since I also need some of these funds to help with moving out, settling in, and buying a car (which will, granted, probably be an old POS paid for in cash. but still!) 

I would strongly appreciate it if anyone gave me tips on how I could best negotiate debt repayment with the collections agencies where I can save the most money/what would be most beneficial to me under these circumstances. 

Basically my situation is this:

\-I owe about $30k in credit card debt, spread out across six credit cards (some as low as $500, some owe as high as $12,000)

\-I currently have $8,000 in cash, and am ""earning"" $4000/month in unemployment for the next three months

\-I moved in with my parents, cook with them, and am mostly confined to my house due to COVID. I’m already saving $4000/mo AFTER taxes and monthly expenses (which is basically my phone bill, spotify, and the occasional fast food burger here and there). Yes, my life sucks right now, but saving all of this money is my only priority right now.

\-I can’t pay off my debts all at once, as I need a couple thousand to help with moving costs once I decide to move out + buy a car (budgeting to pay less than $3k for it; once I pay down my debts I’ll get something more reliable) 

What is the best way for me to administer my funds AND negotiate with collections agencies to help me get out of this hole? I'm making serious progress in terms of saving (at great cost! I love my parents but moving back in with them at 30 is not something I expected) and want to make absolutely sure that with all the sacrifices I'm making that I kill off my debt by negotiating the most favorable terms for me.

I am on file with the clinic as a self-pay patient, but they insist on billing random things through my insurance in spite of this and without my permission. The only reason they have my insurance information is because we used it to verify that I am not covered for anything when I went in for my first appointment. If this worked in my favor, I would be fine with it I suppose, however, because I know 100% that I am not covered for anything they are trying to claim, it has become a giant pain for me.

Because their lab testing is done out of house, I have been getting bills directly from the lab for amounts that are many times the agreed upon self-pay costs if the clinic billed me as self-pay. For example, Estradiol blood work should cost around $50 for me as a self-pay patient from my clinic, but I have a bill sitting in front of me now for $174 because my insurance denied the claim and now the lab is coming after me for it. The lab offers a discount for self-pay, but it is still about twice as much as the self-pay price my clinic was supposed to give me, and the one I have in writing as a quote.

My main problem is that the clinic keeps doing this. Over and over and over. Despite me reiterating in writing and over the phone that I am self-pay. For each invoice, I have to chase the clinic's billing department down to get them to call the lab to straighten out the mess. This ends up taking months, all the while the lab is hounding me for payment that is being billed to me in error. I feel helpless that they may go to collections while my clinic's billing department is twiddling their thumbs.

Is there a better way to deal with this? A way to make the clinic billing department liable for this payment without me getting involved every single time they make the mistake? Can I call my insurance to have them deny any claims from the clinic?

I called my cc company, they confirmed they have been reporting to you, I have zero issues with TU or Experian, I have done everything on my end I know how to do to get this resolved.

They said that they had no record of me trying to get it online, by phone, or by mail. At this point I was frustrated and hung up the phone and filed a cfpb report.

Hoping someone can help me with this question, it's not an easy one to research as I'm not sure all REIT rules apply to IRM - and resources on the subject cover general REIT dividends.

I've owned shares in IRM in tax deferred accounts, but never in a standard brokerage account.

I had no idea until recently that dividends for a REIT are taxed differently than a standard dividend.

Can someone ELI5 me what to expect at the end of the year?

Meaning, do I basically just pay more taxes on the IRM dividend than a normal divendend (as, I guess, a portion of the dividend is taxed as income, and not the dividend rate of 15%)?

And, most importantly, is there anything I need to calculate on my own or does IRM just send me the IRS/tax info I need for that tax year?

If it's anything less than super straightforward I likely won't bother with it in a brokerage account.

***My current few questions:***

Since getting my stimulus check of $1,200 I've had several ideas.

**Scenario 1:**

Use $1,200 to finish buying parts for a self-built project in a hobby of mine, then fund the Ally Individual Investment account and make it an Aristocrat Dividend producing DCA account with the remainder of the stimulus check. Then DCA $100 \~ $200 a month with a 5 individual stock maximum spread of aristocrat stocks. (i.e. Walmart, Amazon, Johnson &amp; Johnson, + 2 more ....). Still need to decide which 5 I feel would be great long term investments for the 5 to purchase in this slump.

 

**Scenario 2:**

Invest all $1,200 of my stimulus into the Ally Individual Investment account, choosing 5 aristocrat companies to evenly disperse the $1,200 between. Then DCA $100 to $200 a month into the account to purchase more of the 5.

&amp;#x200B;

*Question #1:*

Would this be profitable as a Aristocrat Dividend account, that if I am correct would be taxed each year as income based on its performance?

*Question #2:*

What 5 Aristocrat Dividend stocks do you think are at a value price right now and will weather the current situation and continue to maintain its dividends and/or climb?

My original plan was to store the car with my parents and continue with payments until I return, but now I'm considering selling the car before I leave. My concern is on the money wasted on car insurance and state taxes for a car that is not being used. This would be about $1440 for a year of car insurance and another $300 or so for taxes. My concern with selling it though is that I would be losing money on selling a depreciated car that hasn't been fully paid off. The car was originally $12,250 and I currently have $6,800 left on the loan. Currently the only offers I've been quoted range from $8,000-$9000 but those have been dealerships. I'm still considering whether I'd want to deal with the hassle of selling third party, especially with a financed car.

Additional Info: The car is registered in North Carolina.

Those who use the app and make deliveries are considered independent contractors, and it was my understanding that we put aside money to pay our taxes at the end of the year, until today when I found out that not only do you pay taxes at the end of the year, you also have to pay quarterly taxes. I had never imagined something like that existed. I guess it's my fault since I just installed the app and signed up without investigating the intricacies of tax code.  I've been in the work force for a decade but I've always been an employee of the companies I worked for, so my taxes were already withheld, and I'd get refunds when I filed. I've already filed my taxes for 2019, and I had quit my job around August 2019 to attend school.

I'm 28, technically homeless, attending school via pell grants and DoorDash has been helping me buy food and gas, and I had never been educated nor told about quarterly taxes. I'm already over the due date for January to March quarterly taxes and I don't really know how to calculate what I'd owe anyways. I've only made $1,658.36 from January 1st to March 30th. I read that it's something like 15% of your income for that quarter, but I really don't know.

I've called the IRS but they aren't taking phone calls due to staffing concerns. I don't know what to do or even how much money I pay the IRS, combined with any sort of late fees. The IRS doesn't reach out to you about quarterly taxes, you're supposed to take care of it yourself. 

I had read something on eFile that said "" *If you are self-employed, and you expect to owe $1,000 or more in taxes when you file your return, then the IRS requires you to make quarterly estimated tax payments*."" Which is confusing to me, how would I know what I expect to owe at the end of the year?

This is all so stressful, and applying for a meaningful job at this time during COVID-19 seems like a massive under taking. Last semester I was buying 99 cent oatmeal cups and crying myself to sleep because I was so poor and now that I have a good amount of money saved up, I'm deathly afraid of losing all of it because of this tax situation. To top that all off, I used to be recording my mileage when I first started off to use it as a tax write off, but the app I used to record mileage kept crashing my phone and my friend had said he never heard of anyone saving any sort of meaningful amount of money with mileage write offs, so those instances convinced me to not record my mileage anymore, which is now going to bite me in the ass since right now I'd need a write off more than anything.

Hoping for a little help here. I'm in Colorado and my borrower service is Great Lakes, if that helps.

Usually my monthly payment of $135.00 is electronically debited from my bank account on the 27th of each month. Last month, however, no payment was processed. I did not notice this until today, but I logged into my Great Lakes account as soon as I saw that the payment was never taken.

My account shows that the payment from last month was indeed not taken, but it also says that my account is not in past-due status, and is in good standing.

I thought that GL may have forgiven or postponed that payment due to Covid, but I have received no communication from them regarding this, nor is there any language in my GL account that suggests that they may have done this.

Out of an abundance of caution, I did make a manual payment of $135.00. After processing the payment, I got this notification: **You'll receive credit on your account as of the payment date listed.**

This tells me that GL is actually seeing today's payment as an over-payment, and while I won't miss paying the bill at the usual time later this month, I want to ask you if you might know what the heck is going on. My main concern is getting into some kind of missed-payment trouble with GL over something I had no control over.

312,t3_gfdqob,"Im in sort of a unique situation and have a question about the best way to save for retirement if I dont have access to any tax deferred account types because of my status as an american expat. I will soon begin to work as an expatriate software engineer in Japan after coronavirus and plan to stay for the long term.

Originally I thought to just open an IRA before I left and transfer money to this account monthly using a cheap transfer service like transferwise, but after some more research I cant do this after my first year of residency in another country because I will not have taxable income in the US anymore. So I do not qualify for either a 401k or IRA anymore either.

My next thought was to use whatever Japan's equivalent of the 401k/IRA tax deferred account is, which is the NISA (Nippon Individual Savings Account). But unfortunately, even though this account is tax deferred in Japan, the IRS considers this a normal taxable offshore account and will tax capitol gains, defeating the purpose entirely. So Im stuck between a rock and a hard place.

My last option then, would be to just open a taxable brokerage account in the US. My research indicates that vanguard and fidelity are not expat friendly for this purpose, but Interactive brokers is, so my plan is to open an account with them, transfer money to my US bank account monthly, and make regular contributions to target date funds and mutual funds. This would allow the account to grow in USD, and because the SP500 has outperformed the Nikkei225 (Japans equivalent to SP500) historically it seems like a better option then keeping my money in Japan. I would have to pay close attention to the exchange rates though, or dollar cost average. Even though this strategy would be taxed by the US I see some advantage here as over the long term I expect to see some phantom gains because of the currency conversion between the yen and USD. Additionally, Japan's interest rates for mortgages are astronomically low (1-2%!) and housing is cheaper then the area I lived in in the US.

We bought a rental home in 2016 for something like $220k. Right now it's very likely to sell for about $275k, which is great appreciation. We currently make $300/mo. over the mortgage cost. 
***Edit- we make $1650/mo, which is $300 over the monthly mortgage fee*** 

Now, we didn't buy this house to flip it. We've invested almost nothing in it, other than down payment, which we would get back in the sale. We were planning to just rent it out forever, allowing the renters to pay off the mortgage, so selling it sort of goes against the whole plan we had. 

But... the housing market is doing well. It may pop soon, or not. Either way, we could sell it at this great profit, and then just buy another home again a few years down the line when we can get more for our money than we did in 2016.

The PIP is leading toward termination and my direct supervisor has even said that I could use them as a reference and that they believe this just isn't the right fit for me. In a way, I agree with them, but in the current setting (COVID-19), nobody is hiring and it is just the worst possible time. Much of my PIP has been documented and I have kept documentation of my improvements (albeit not enough) and how they've stated that I am a good employee and this may just not be a good fit for me. I've now been given the option to resign, which would give me a better chance to come back to the company in a different department and position at a later point, or to continue with the PIP and HR process that involves me having a ""hearing"" where I state my case and my bosses state theirs. We all believe my termination is inevitable.

My biggest fear is that I resign and then don't get unemployment benefits, which are very needed right now. They've told me they would not contest my unemployment claim and I believe them. I've worked with them for quite some time now and it does seem like everything is genuine and that it is just a case of me not fitting in this position. Not to mention that I have most if not all of it in writing as well.

Most will instantly say to not quit because I won't receive unemployment and that HR is just lying to get out of paying for this, which I am thinking that as well, believe me... But my biggest question is that since I have had this PIP in place and can basically prove that termination was inevitable due to this position not being a good fit, even though I am a good employee, will that help ensure that I get unemployment? Also, will it even come down to my employer approving/contesting my claim because I resigned? I've read a decent amount into forceful resignation, and most cases seem like they just come out of the blue rather than a multi-month documentation process. My thoughts are that since this has been a process and is not due to misconduct or me just not wanting to work there anymore, that I should still get unemployment, but I wanted to get thoughts on this.

I also spoke with another supervisor in a different department that I'm personal friends with and she stated that they have offered this same thing and it seems genuine, but they aren't HR and don't know what happens past that offering.

We both recently graduated from university and have a combined $28K in student debt. 5K for me, and 23K for her.

Credit details:

1. Mine (679) During college I went late on a credit card payment 3 times.
2. Hers (685) No late payments, just a small window of credit history

3 ) I paid off my auto loan last month and got a pay for delete collection item removed last month from my credit report.

4) We have no other debt.

Savings:

We have $10,000 in our robinhood which I aim to pull out soon.

We also have $50,000K in a cash low interest savings account.

We have been living rent free for the past year and have managed to save $65,000 (50K for me and about 15K for her) in about 11 months time. As of right now, I am saving 5K a month and she is saving 3K a month.

Around time of purchasing house we should be about 70K in cash savings.

Downpayment:

I think putting 5% down on a 500K house would be $25K plus closing costs of say $10K is reasonable. We should also be comfortable with 6 months of emergency funds.

The issues:

We both have outstanding debt, low employment history and low credit scores.

We also plan to do graduate studies (masters) and our field of focus is for me (programming for scientific research) and her (materials engineer) and the boulder/denver area is great for all of the research centers, job opps in our field, as well as CU Boulder for both of our further studies.
2. It's the Arvada area in Colorado, we have family over Longmont, Boulder and Aspen (visited the area (Boulder, Longmont) multiple times in the last year). So yes, we do know the area and more importantly, the area fits our life style quite well. Also, our jobs will most likely be in Boulder, so the commute would be around 20 mins to 50 mins (depending on traffic) on the days we do go into office.
3. Paying off debt: My aim is to pay off the 5K in student debt from a gift from my dad of 2.5k and 2.5k of my own money in the next month or two (it's 0% interest currently and would be good to just get rid of it). As for her, she aims to pay off 5K by next month and wants to pay the rest of over the next year.

I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm trying to figure out how best to invest some monthly recurring income. I've already looked at the flow chart on options, but, still feel unsure, and I just want to hear some people who have been in similar positions. 

About me, 40, 3 kids, divorced, no debt minus house, pay some child support / alimony, have 4 months of emergency funds in high yield savings, doing max contributions to 401k, high earner, generally pretty frugal for day to day life. I'm not going to put money away for kids college at this time, as I am behind on where I think I should be for retirement. 

I'm trying to figure out where I should put these extra funds (1 - 2k /month). 

A really big part of me says, buy real estate. I don't mind the idea of being a land lord. I could see myself doing this full time while unemployed later on in life. I like the idea of building passive income + possibly building equity / wealth with it. I live in a place that is a renters market and will be for some time. But, after this pandemic, and the likelyhood of having to keep leverage on myself with a mortgage to purchase said rental, I'm wondering if that's the right choice. I could likely get into rentals cash only if I wanted to wait 3 or 4 years and find the right deal and kept saving. But, does that equal lost oppurtunity? And given the lack of want to carry a mortgage, the accruing of these assets is a long term thing it feels like. 

OR

Should I say screw it to all those things, and setup a separate brokerage account and start diversifying that way. I'm pretty green to this, and I'm still working on getting my understanding of how to approach this now that I have doubts about my initial plan. Would this be an easy way to do the same things above? Pros/cons? No idea here yet.

OR

Do I pay off the house? I like the appeal of it where I'm only on the hook for taxes, repairs, and living expenses in life. But, I don't need this size house for the rest of my life. My kids will all be adults in 10ish years and hopefully out of the house. I would think I would maybe downsize. So this doesn't seem ideal. And I don't think there is a definitive win or lose in this category to really push me to do it or not other than the emotional debt free want.

I see a lot of people in this sub talking about loans on credit cards, wondering if they should pay their credit card loan of putting the same money in an account etc. How does that work? It seems very different that how it works where I live in France. 

How it works here : you have a credit card, you spend the money you actually have in your bank account liked to the card. You can be authorised to go under 0€ left in your account but we're talking about 200-500€, if you go above ('under' would be more appropriate) you're paying heavy interests (to prevent you doing it, regular loan's interests being maybe 10 times less), and if it's too often the bank will just take back the credit card or automatically decline payment if your balance isn't sufficient. 

There is no such thing as ""paying credit card loan"", the bank will just prevent you go too deep without asking for your opinion. When you get your salary, if you're balance is negative you can't choose to pay your due to the bank or not, if you're at -500 and getting 200, then you're now at -300, period. 

As a result absolutely everyone has a credit card without much of consumerism problem. Teenagers have a CB that's declined without proper balance, limited in the amount that can be spent/withdrawd per day and per week and per month.

We technically qualify for the free tier of tax filing software given our AGI, but I've been struggling to find a free option that allows us to do so (e.g. can't file with Turbotax due to aggressive AGI requirements, H&amp;R Block allows filing, but won't allow joint federal with separate state). Is my understanding of our state filing requirements correct? And if so, would anyone be able to point me in the direction of which service I can use to do this semi-unique filing situation?",(US) Tax filing help for recently married couple in different states,r/personalfinance,0.67,1,1588900649.0,1,0
361,t3_gfao2y,"Having recently graduated, my wife and I plan to move from Missouri to Oregon. Apart from applying for jobs like crazy, we're having some issues deciding the best way to ""live"" there. Renting seems ridiculously expensive (and we're sick of it), and since we plan to live there for 10+ years, are considering buying for the first time.

I see a lot of Redditors in the past replying on posts about manufactured homes negatively due to their depreciation over time. I don't know if it helps any, but if we went that route we would probably be more willing to get a rural plot of land, outside the city a ways, and set it up as much like a real house as possible, possibly even with a porch/deck area if funding allowed.

My credit score is pretty good, it fluctuates around 800. My wife has a lot less credit history, but has never had any issues whatsoever with late payments or anything that would effect it negatively.

We have around 10k in savings (though 1k or so is tied up in a relatively new Vanguard Roth IRA).

She plans on going back to school for her PHD.

We don't plan on spending over 150k-180k (though we have not been approved for that amount or anything, yet).

I also worry that since we are moving, we won't be accepted for a loan due to the short amount of time we will be at our next jobs (assuming we get jobs, etc.) is this the case?

Also looking for info on home loans (or manufactured loans, if that route sounds decent) is also more than welcome. I know there are some first time home buyer plans out there, but looking up information on that seems unnecessarily complicated. Is it easiest to decide on a loan company and then ask them about these plans, or what?


Please let me know if you need more information to better answer.

Edit: I guess to clarify, I’m not saying I necessarily need to buy RIGHT NOW, we are totally prepared to rent if necessary. Either way we will be buying eventually, so all information helps even if it is years down the road.

This post is also more about future plans and setting goals, so we know what we need before we do any of this. So, next year, two years, whatever is necessary we just want to know what we need before considering this, and there’s so many options we feel overwhelmed with it all. So, we’re trying to narrow down our options.

I asked them about what they would need from me, say if ""get selected"", they'll need what equal to about 300 bucks (one time fee to pay for a platform and recurring $100 a month to get content on how to run it). Unlike the last guy's theirs was an e-commerce.

It seems like some scammers really prey on that need for people to learn entrepreneurship by using this model.

I do not need to pay PMI currently, so in order to continue avoiding PMI, the refinance would need to be less than 80% of the home value. So at a $200k valuation, that would be $160k. 

However, the neighborhood we are living in is starting to become more popular as older folks renovate their homes and sell them to younger families starting out. A smaller home sold down the street for $280k, and another smaller home sold for about $200k with one less bedroom, bathroom, and 500 less square feet.

My question is how does the refinancing lender determine home value? Will they have their own appraiser come and see what the value of the home is, or would we have to hire our own appraiser to determine the value of the home. The reason this would help would be because if the value of the home was raised to $220k, then around $175k would be the magic 80% that would allow us to avoid PMI.

Background: I started contributing to my 401K about 6 years ago, and at the time I chose a target date fund. My plan sucks, and the target date fund for my age group has a 1.3% expense ratio. A few years ago my employer added some more more favorable options to the plan, and I deferred all of my new contributions to Fidelity's FXAIX 500 Index which has a .02% expense ratio. They also added cheap bond and international stock indexes, which I haven't gotten into yet. As of today I have about $45K in FXAIX, and $35K in the target date fund.

What I would like to do at some point is move the funds out of the target date fund, and rebalance that across FXAIX, bonds, and international. What I'm not clear on is the best strategy for this. One concern is that selling the target date fund at its current price would be realizing a loss. I don't want to try to time the market, but since this is the first time I'll ever be selling an investment I want to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid. I also understand that this shouldn't be a taxable event since all of the money is staying inside the 401K, but not sure if there are any exceptions to that. Finally, I suppose I have the option of leaving the target date fund as-is, and contributing to other funds until I have achieved roughly the portfolio that I want.

We live in a town where everything is over 10 miles away and bad public transit. Car issues ended up happening and I didn't see the money. I was in my early 20s so I was irresponsible and didn't take my finances seriously ill admit it. More things happened like this and I didnt pay attention to spending. Ive been holding around 20k for the past few years paying it up and down and recent events took it past that.  Entered my late twenties and started a new job in January that would have set me up to pay this debt off but was furloughed and living off credit cards the past few months. In my town over 30% of residents have been laid off or furloughed since most of our business relies on tourism. Been trying to find another job but its rough until tourism opens back up. My expenses balance out with my unemployment right now but not for long. Moving back in with my mom and trying to cut where I can. Made a tight budget and trying hard to stick to it. Credit score is at 550. Pre Corona income was about 80k. Unemployment income is about 3k/month. Dropping to 1200/month in July once the extra assistance is gone.. When we go back to work I expect my income to fall to about 40k/yr until tourism ramps back up.

Compiled my debt into balance and % below:

$8,899	22.49%
$1,044	19.49%
$1,360	17.74%
$13,064	16.99%
$3,885	15.99%
$14,506	15.99%
$4,272	14.74%

My monthly budget:

Food		$300
Rent		$870
Auto payment and insurance 	$800
Utilities		$160
Debt		$1000

I was over last month because had a root canal which set me back $1k with no insurwnce. They said I need another but it hasn't given me toothaches yet so going to try and hold off.

Everything paid on time but minimum payments are over $1000. Over 300 in interest being charged a month. Mostly chase cards and 1 discover. Wanted to go over my options. 

1) I've seen people calling banks and having luck with reducing their balance by offering to pay 25-30% in full. Does anyone have experience on this with chase? Or is it an option when I'm closer to collections?

2) Loan consolidation program. Consolidate into one lower apr loan. Is this recommended and anyone have reliable companies that will approve me with my credit score and unemployment?

3) Bankruptcy? I would like to avoid this at all costs. But the feeling of impending doom is looming over me. I'm willing to fight til my last breath to take ownership of my actions. 

I know this was preventable and take 100% blame. Just trying to make sense of things and appreciate your feedback.",Need help with 40k credit card debt,r/personalfinance,1.0,1,1588895069.0,26,0

Recently me and my wife are starting the process of buying a house. Did the credit report and found out she did not have a score or history. Found out her mother took her off their credit card a little after we moved into our apartment we have been for 3 years. Found out our monthly rent doesn't get reported which is a bummer.

So I added her as an authorized user on both of credit cards. One of them is a local credit union and the other is a Capital One. Did a free credit report last Friday from TransUnion and it only shows my credit union on her history now. Did an Experian last night and it shows the same thing. We payed to see her credit score and she has a score of 712 now and says thin credit file detected.

400,t3_gf89v0,"I applied the advice of the PF sub since college, 27 now. I reached place with my finances (and the Prime Directive) where I do not know how to proceed. I believe I am at the last(?) step to max out retirement or save for big purchases. Could not have gotten to this stage without this sub!

Here are my goals and I do not know how to balance or prioritize them:

1. **Retire Early:** I want to have enough to retire by 60. I want to work as long as I can, as I enjoy work but want to provide some cushion to pull the trigger if I need to.

* $70K between all my retirement accounts currently
* This year I am maxing out my Roth IRA and HSA (6K+3.5K) and put 5% for company match 401K.
* I was going to do a total of 16% for my 401K but I think that is saving way too much.
* How much should I put extra into my 401K to retire by 60? I feel like I have been over saving, which is a good thing but how much is enough? All the calculators and articles online have varying advice.

1. **Buy a House:** $280's - $330's in my MCOL area (currently spend $950 for rent but the place is small, 1 washer and dryer between 8 units - moving in February no matter what, rent will go up)
2. **Buy a car in 3-4 years:** preferably a used Tesla ($40K?). Current car is 5 years old @ 70K miles and runs great

* Salary: $90K
* Savings ($79.7K): $36K in cash (HYSA), $33k in Brokerage, $4k in stocks, $6.7K old companies ESPP (sell 1/2 in summer)
* Budget: $3086/month - includes $950 for rent,  tires, estimated maintenance (battery &amp; oil), vacation, food, entertainment, spending money, etc.

With everything laid out I think I am over saving for retirement because I have no idea what the $ goal should be. How much should I be saving? At minimum I want to max Roth + HSA + 5% 401K match.

Saving for a house: Is that too much house for me to afford + reach my retirement goals? It seems affordable to me \~2k/month with Mortgage+Insurance+Taxes. I would want to buy within the next 1-3 years, earlier the better. Do I need to have 6 months emergency fund + downpayment + closing cost  before I buy? - Is my current savings enough?

Saving for a car, do I need to have saved 100% of the cost of the car by time I buy? Or should I finance, what is a good down payment, 20%? Think I could sell my current car for $4-5K in 3-4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a freshman in high school and by senior year, I want to buy an Audi R8. Here’s my plan, can someone tell me if it’s feasible? 

To be clear, I don’t want to buy a new R8, but a used one. I assume that by 2023, they’ll be around 40k. I know it’s not the smartest idea to buy a depreciating asset over real estate of something that won’t depreciate, but I think the R8’ll have decent residual and I won’t take much of a loss if I sell if during/ before college. Plus it’s more fun than buying a rental property 😅.

Regardless, my plan is to work every summer for 40 hours at a summer camp that starts at 10 bucks an hour, but that goes up over time. During the school year I plan on working to tutor kids. I assume I’ll net around 10k per year. I plan to actively invest in ETFs, mutual funds, and the stock market. I’m reading The Intelligent Investor, and working on sharpening my skills.

I just got off the phone with two different supervisors from the hospital billing department and they show I owe a zero balance, my original credit cleared and wiped out the payment. It took over a month to do so and they had no idea why, the best reason I could get was because everyone is working from home because of Covid. It was sent to collections at 4am for 15 minutes before part of the debt was rescinded by the hospital. Even though it was such a short time the collections agency auto printed a bill. The collections agency is still saying I owe like 20 bucks but I got both agents to send out an email to them saying I owe a zero balance and then I am getting an itemized receipt in the mail showing my bill has been closed out. That way if I get a call from collections, I can tell them to shove it because I have proof. You are all so wonderful and I cannot thank you enough. Thank you so much /r/personalfinance 

Hey everyone So back in November i suffered some heart issues and went to the hospital. That bill was paid in full but then I had to go to a cardiologist. I had to have some procedures done. I paid up front for my Echo and because of that and because of another billing error, there was a credit for 232.50 on my account. I have called billing 4 times and spoken to 4 associates who have told me every time that the credit was applied to my account and I owe nothing. I knew something was up and the last time I called I asked the representative who I talked to me to email me a confirmation email with her information and the confirmation number of the credit being transferred. 

I never received it, Jump to less than a week later while I am in the mist of stress because of finals and I just got a letter saying I was sent to collections. To say that my mind is completely blown is an understatement. The hospital and cardiologist both operate under the same hospital company and the same billing agency. Does anyone have any advice for me when I call the billing department tomorrow and then I have to talk to the collections agent? I am asking for the name of every single person I speak to and I am going to reconfirm that there is the credit on my account. that way i will know that the original billing agents I talked to did nothing. I have an email confirmation that shows I paid the exact amount that was due and then the credit would have covered the rest. Once I see that I have the credit still on my account (This has to be the case) I am going to ask to talk to a supervisor to see what the heck is happening. if the hospital owes me money, is there anyway I can get that back? I am 23 years old and getting sent to collections is making me sick. I just got the letter today and I am still within the 30 day period to dispute. Will this go on my credit record forever showing I was sent to collections and will this affect when i eventually get a house or a car? I am so stressed right now with school and this that I could pull my hair out.

TLDR: hospital has a credit on my account that would have wiped out my medical bill. Talked to 3 reps telling me that the credit was applied over the period of a month. continued to get notices saying I owed the same amount. Talked to another rep and they said It was 100% taken care of.  I got a notice today saying I was sent to collections and i don't have any idea what to do.

EDIT: I am going to preemptively edit this now just to say I am young and naive. I thought that when a rep told me my bill was wiped out, it actually was. I should have got on record the names of every associate i talked to and asked for an email and letter showing the credit on my account.

i just need a little help for selecting a cat policy.  


I kind of aimed for emergencies and two insurances. Petplan and Healthypawns.

Petplan has dental for illness but they coverage is more limited if i want to stay in the same price range of a monthly premium of 20 Dollars per pet. I have 3 cats.

412,t3_gf7nom,"Hi All,

Long time lurker. I have followed the prime directive and guidance of the sub and am grateful to all of you for the advice you give so many.

I'm a bit worried about the uncertainty of the world right now, and am hoping to get counsel on how I'm doing and what changes I maybe ought to be making to prepare. I don't come from money and don't necessarily have a good barometer for these things so any context is greatly appreciated.

**About me:** I (26m) live with my S/O (24f) in a condo I owe around 184k on. Purchase price was 215k in 2018, and most estimates put current value around 220-250k (who knows what'll happen in the real estate market though). I recently took a 15% paycut from 80k/yr. I work and do relatively well in an essential function, but for an organization (small university) that is getting slammed right now. We have a small endowment, but it won't hold long if the industry feels the stretch for more than a year or two. My S/O made around 45k/yr doing graphic design, but just had her hours cut by 50%. We have about 70k in high yield savings accounts between us, no debt besides the mortgage, and maybe another 15k between my 401(k) and checking accounts. We've cut our monthly expenses down to roughly $2,500/mo between us, the majority of which is for housing, utilities, and food. No real vices, no ongoing subscriptions besides netflix and Amazon prime.

**My worry:** I'm worried we're falling behind. My co workers all drive way nicer cars, and tell me they are getting 5-10% returns in the market and that at 1.5% savings rates we're missing out. I know you're supposed to only keep 6/mo in a savings account but I am scared that if we get our pay cut more we'll need to live off savings. I live in a HCOL area, so my condo is small and shabby compared to all my peers. I drive a POS. I feel like I must make a least similar to what they do but they seem to be managing money more wisely and living in much better circumstances. With my pay getting cut, and my SO's hours getting cut, I'm worried that we're just falling behind even faster.

We were billed for $1100 after insurance had been added. We have applied for financial aid through the hospital and are waiting approval. Now, the bill is due this week. 

I have spoken to the FA rep, they stated that no amount that is already paid will be refunded if any is approved. They also stated that after four billing statements have passed/sent to us you will be sent to collections.

My question is should we make a partial/monthly payment just to say we made a payment until we hear back from the FA office?

426,t3_gffbih,"Trading on margin gets a really bad rap in this subreddit, but it can be a powerful tool to use in one's investing strategy.

I should preface this post by saying that I'm by no means experienced in investing and that everything I'm saying here is a condensed version of [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340) in the National Bureau of Economics Research by two professors at Yale. This paper advocates for taking on high margin (i.e. 2x -3x) to invest in market cap weighted ETFs for investors in their 20s and early 30s. People should then decrease their exposure to the market over time by first reducing margin and then incorporating bonds into their portfolio.

**Expected Returns**

It's pretty well understood that trading on margin will yield higher returns on investments. If you can get a margin at a [1-2% interest rate](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376&amp;p=m) and the stock market increases by an average of [10% a year](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp), it's pretty clear that investing ETFs on margin leads to positive expected return.

**Volatility**

Normally, increasing your exposure to markets through margin increases your volatility. However, by taking on margin when young, people can get greater time diversification in their portfolio, reducing market risk. Intuitively, investing with no margin makes my total returns disproportionately sensitive to market conditions near retirement, as you have the most money then. Through both historical records and bootstrapped simulations, the paper finds that the worst performing portfolios taken under margin actually outperform the worst performing portfolios without margin.

**Some Caveats**

* This paper assumes that people's incomes either stay the same or increase over time. Generally true, but definitely some exceptions (i.e. athlete, entertainer)
* It also assumes that people will behave rationally and stick with the plan despite losses and margin calls.

In early/mid March when this all started going crazy, I changed the direction of my income, and started putting a lot of it in savings, called the Private loan provider and put the loan in forbearance until July 7th, to give myself as much room to save as much as possible. 

Before all of this I was living on the edge, to be honest, with a measly $500 emergency fund...Mostly because I couldn't swallow not putting most of my income towards student loans. 

So here's my question...

I have about 5k in savings now after a month and a half of saving vigorously. That Private Student Loan payment is brutally large, at almost $800/mo. I am wondering now **if I should take most of my current savings and cut the Private loan nearly in half, and work my tail off to pay that private loan off ASAP, get rid of the $800 payment before the end of summer and then try to save as much as possible before that Sept 30th date when I could be looking at a furlough?** I hadn't really considered this until this morning. I was feeling very comfortable and had a peace of mind with all that cash there to protect me during these weird times, but this new idea seems to make a little more sense, strategically. 

I want to know what you would do? Or how do you feel about my new plan?

A little about my essential expenses and income:

* Income (after taxes, 401k, health insurance): \~$3,500/mo (was usually about $4-4,500 before our hours were dropped starting back in April)
* Rent: $1,000/mo
* Utilities: \~$55/mo
* Groceries: \~$200-300/mo
* Transportation: \~$50-75/mo
* Phone is covered

444,t3_gf5c35,"When I retire in 3 or 4 years, I want to to take a monthly fractional ratio distribution of all my savings related to how many months I estimate I have left to live so in the end I die broke, or close to it. 

For example: at 65 I may have 25 years to live, if I make it to 90. That would be 25 years x 12 months = 300 months. So, say I have $300,000 saved.

So what I want to do is, the first month I am retired I want 1/300 of my savings total, in this case it would be $1000. The second month I want 1/299 of my remaining total so, without figuring earnings, in this case 1/299 of 299,000 would again be $1000. The third month 1/298 of 298,000, again $1000. Simple?

The problem comes in figuring the earnings rolled into the total. I'm not very good in the maths department for figuring out how to estimate how much I would get each month once the earnings are added in. I hope to get 4-5% if that is not asking too much.

Can anyone give me a simple way to add in the expected return so I can get a good idea of how much I might receive every month.

446,t3_gf8pgv,"After a bachelors degree in psych and an accelerated second degree nursing program, I am looking at about $83k of debt for undergrad (I know it's crazy but I can't change it now). Now, my plan is to start working as an RN with a salary of $60-70k (most likely more than this with OT and/or a second job). I'd say this salary is lowballing it for my area, but I'm playing it safe and planning for worst case. I would plan on putting $1700 a month into loans, $500+ a month into a savings and use the rest for the few bills I have and spending money (I live from home so I have no rent or living expenses; my dad is also generous and probably won't make me pay for some of my bills like phone or car insurance). I want to do this for 2-3 years and then apply to CRNA school. 

If I stick to this plan for 2 years, I'll have about $45k left in undergrad loans when starting CRNA school. If I do this for 3 years, I'll have about $30k left in undergrad loans when starting. Honestly, I'd rather start with more debt and earn the high salary quicker, so if I get the required experience in time, I'll be looking to start with $45k in undergrad loans.

So, CRNA school will probably cost me anywhere between $100k-150k, depending on my savings and living situation at the time. CRNA school is extremely time consuming for its 3 years and it's nearly impossible to work, so I will most likely have to supplement myself with more loans. When it's all said and done, I'm looking at about $150k-200k in loans including the remaining undergrad balance.

I know this sounds terrifying and I honestly am TERRIFIED, but the salary is crazy high for CRNAs. The starting salary in my city is over $160k and the average salary is $200k with experience/OT. With many years of experience, I can make over $250k. If I live below my means once again post graduation for 3-4 years, I strongly believe these loans will become manageable. Am I stupid to believe this? My only other option would be to go to an FNP program and pay $50-75k for tuition, but I'd be lucky if I made $120k a year (not that this is a bad salary, but it is when you're over $100k in debt). 

TLDR: is $150-200k in debt worth it for a CRNA degree with a starting salary of $160k than can reach as high as $250k many years down the line (average of about $200k in my city)?",Is CRNA school going to be worth the debt for me?,r/personalfinance,0.25,0,1588894338.0,2,0
447,t3_gevsi7,"A few years ago I started contributing to my company's 401k without knowing hardly anything about investing. I'd picked a Target Date Fund and figured any investing was better than no investing, and when I had the time I'd sit down and learn more about investing...

Well that time is now.

I already knew my company offered no matching. And I've discovered that my 401k's gross expense ratio is 0.27% meanwhile Fidelity has a Target Date Fund for the same year at 0.12% (FDEWX).

The two accounts I closed were an Amex every day blue card which I probably used 10 times in a year for gas and groceries, and a B of A card that I opened to get the $200 MLB store reward after spending 2k in 2 months (seems silly looking back but I got got). After that, I never used it again.

I did basic research and it seems normal for credit scores to drop if you close accounts, however, I do not recognize the CBE Group.

Because I’m selling the house, she’s trying to get an apartment. The complex she applied at ran her credit and denied her. She had been applying for houses with some other friends and everything had been fine there. She’s looking into why she was denied, but I want to see if I can help her in any without causing any issues for myself.

Before she moved in with my she was helping care for her parents - her mother in particular who was ill and had had major surgeries. So she doesn’t have any recent landlord/renter credit history.

Eta: Removed that last sentence. I appreciate the info everyone has provided on that and I will definitely be looking into filing my taxes correctly for 2020. My 2019 taxes have already been filed and I’ve already paid out hundreds to the government because I spent 6 months last year on unemployment while looking for work. I’m going to hold my breath and hope they’re satisfied with that and if I get audited one day, I hope to be in a better financial position to pay them more. Messing with it at this point seems ill advised.

This is... overwhelming. XD I’m working atm (on a break) and trying thank, updoot, and comment on what I can.

Re: 2019s taxes. Here’s the thing. I’m not saying I will never, ever deal with them. I’m saying right now, for the foreseeable future, imma let the government be happy with the money they got from me and not poke sticks at a hornets nest. I have no money. None. Zero. I’m selling my house because I literally can’t afford to live here. 

I cannot refinance the loan, I tried. I cannot open a line of credit to consolidate my debt, I tried. I cannot ask for more credit to transfers money and pay down other accounts so I’m not paying 23% interest, I tried. I cannot get my interest rates lowered, I tried. Selling my house is very literally my only available means of getting out of debt I have available besides bankruptcy and bankruptcy would effectively ruin my credit and they’d take my house anyway so... may as well do it on my terms. 

My point is, I’m fucking broke. I used my stimulus check to +pay the government back+ because I had no money to pay them. If I go in right now and screw around with my taxes and end up owing them more money... that’s going to add more stress and pressure on me than I can currently deal with. Once my house sells and I get things settled? I can revisit that. I pay my damn taxes. I don’t have insurance through my employer so I’ve made sure I have some anyway. I do what I’m supposed to do. But adding you owe $$$ to the government right now when my bank account was at -$288.23 yesterday because my insurance and electric bill came out (plus their overdraft fees) before my paycheck went in, well, I really don’t have the mental or emotional strength to deal with that. I will either deal with it after my house sells, or I’ll deal with it when I do taxes next year and file the proper paperwork then. But yeah, right now, I’ll risk it.

Eta3: Okay, I’m down to less than 70 unread replies. I haven’t even gotten to threaded comments.

I am looking into the information y’all are providing. And I appreciate it greatly! My roommate got in contact with an apartment service that will help her find a place based on her credit. Apparently depending on who they check with her credit is either in the low 600s or the mid 520s. There’s a solid 80+ point difference. 

I ordered a basic receipt book for rent and will fill them out according to our Venmo history. I’m also going to write a short letter for her. It’s not going to be rainbows and unicorns. It’s going to be basically “Roommate has lived at 123 Steet Rd, City, State Zipcode since Date. As per our agreement, Roommate contributed to $XXX rent and $XXX utilities monthly.” And then stick a quick Excel graph with the dates and amounts below it to correspond to the payment dates. She also can pull those dates up on her Venmo for veracity. That way she has a letter confirming residence and payment history as well as receipts, should she need either.

I will also check into what’s involved as far as seeing if I can report her payments to the credit bureaus. If I do that, I’ll +definitely+ be amending my taxes sooner than later, but it will still be until after I have money to do anything about it.

For those curious and not wanting to dig through threads, I’ll give y’all the down and dirty of my life and how I ended up in this mess.

I got the house when I was 21 because of my mom’s inheritance. When I married a few years later, we took out a 7 year mortgage. We paid it off. Husband turned out to be a gaslighting, narcissistic emotionally and mentally abusive asshole. I wound up with untreated major depressive disorder and was suicidal. He forced me to take out a 30 year mortgage on the house. I managed to trick him in letting me go to a doctor for “lady reasons” and instead told my GP to put me on antidepressants because dying is pretty permanent. After 6 months of being on antidepressants I realized how fucked up everything was and divorced him after 14 years of marriage.

I kept the house.

He really hated that. He really thought 50/50 law meant he got to take everything he wanted and we’d sell the house and he’d get tons of money. Nah, the house was in my name only, always had been. The loans were only ever in my name. State law (and my lawyer) said he had zero claim to it. So he punished me by ensuring I had as much debt to deal with as possible.

I went from a single credit card with $1500 debt to $15,000 over a couple cards. And eventually that because $30,000 and now it’s closer to $40k. Why you ask? Well... there was that time I got T-boned by a hit-and-run driver and had major hospital bills. The time my work place fired me because I have chronic migraines and major depressive disorder and was going to the doctor and taking medication for treatments (it’s funny how chiropractors frown on that). The time my house flooded because my ex fancied himself a plumber and his handiwork caused thousands of dollars in damage out of pocket after insurance. The time a pipe broke in my front yard because my ex had hired a cheap plumber to install a water softener system and they used parts not meant to be buried and the seals dissolved and had been leaking water for... what? maybe upwards of a year? The time the water heater broke and had to be replaced and because my ex had chosen someone cheap, yet again, we discovered scorch marks on the wall and had to completely get a different system to be installed in a different location. The time I finally convinced my insurance to replace to roof, but despite asking for them to come do it for years, they had waited so long that when they did, there was a six foot section with black mold under it that they wouldn’t cover that was put pf pocket for me to cover. That time the year old cat had to go to the hospital for emergency surgery or die. That time a year later where he had to go back to the hospital for more surgery or die. That time the oldest dog died. That time the oldest cat died. That time my car insurance dropped me because of the hit and run since it was so expensive and I thought I got comparable insurance but somehow collision wasn’t on it and on my way to work in a massive nighttime storm, I couldn’t see a median and it ripped my undercarriage out. (I did convince the city to make the median more visible so hopefully I’m the last person it happens to.) So, to be fair, in the past two and a half years, it’s been a bit hectic and not because I can’t control my spending. I’m just patently unlucky.

So that’s all why I’m in debt and selling my house. The house I lived in for 20 years. But it’s good. I’m looking forward to making new memories in a new place.

I also have contacted both an accountant and a relator. I know what I want to list for, what I will settle for, how much I’ll take home more or less (I’m erring on less) after the immediate people get paid, my mortgage gets paid off, and all my outstanding debts get paid off. Probably $20k - $25k will go into an IRA I started a few years ago but have not been able to contribute to since the divorce. (Yes I account for it on my taxes.) $15k each will be gifted to my dad, my mom, and my friend who has been here with me while I fell apart and have been slowly putting myself together. Just as a thank you for them being there for me. $5k each will go to two of my friends who have stood by me and talked me down numerous times. A $1000 to a friend who has shown up at my house with groceries because he knew I just didn’t have food and hadn’t eaten in days. The rest will cover the costs of moving, fees, setting up services, rent, etc and then the chunk left over with go into a high interest savings account for Oh Shit emergencies. I will keep my $5000 limit low interest credit card as my active card and pay it off monthly. But if an emergency hits, I can use savings to pay it off and then pay into my savings until it’s back up instead of making credit card payments.

457,t3_geossn,"Oh wow, okay. My experience with Mint has been... Rough. Scroll down for a list of things to do to stop using Mint without deleting your entire Intuit account, if you don't want to listen to me ~~rant about~~ review the free product (which we all know means they're selling your data).

Let's start with the beginning. YNAB, some random spreadsheet, or Mint. Decided on the free one that shouldn't involve as much work and ""getting it to work right"". And I'd used Turbotax and Quickbooks in the past, so I figured I knew what I was getting in to. Turbotax was well written to guide you through setup and inputting information, and Quickbooks combined that with some good manual editing and updating functions.

**What was good:**

Auto update feature (when it worked, see below).  
Active notifications when unexpected bills occur.  
Active notification if account balance is low or negative.  
""Bucket"" budgeting feature was usually accurate, with only the occasional manual edit.  
Notification if those budgets were close or exceeded.  
Initial setup seemed to be simple and quick, until you got into the nitty and gritty of budget buckets.  
Offered by a known financial company, so privacy and security should have been good.  
Some budget is better than no budget.

**What was bad:**

From the start, the interface was strange. I felt like it might be hard to find functions as there was no ""main menu"" to speak of, only a couple buttons here and there.  
A large button for ""add accounts"" always available on the every single page, but the ability to see a list of linked accounts? Buried.  
Expenses are a hassle to enter, and half the time wouldn't save. My ""rent"" bill is still, to this day, sitting at the rent I had 2 years ago when I first set it up, because when I'd click ""save"", it would just sit there spinning forever.  
Lack of linking. If I have an auto loan and an automotive asset, there was no way to link the two. Let alone any kind of insurance cost.  
Money transfers. If I transferred money from one account to another it would always register as an expense. There was no way to cancel the income from one account and the outflow from another, so your ""pay"" would be super high, and ""expenses"" would be super low. Thus, any ""pay tracking"" or ""overall expense tracking"" was essentially useless.  
And the biggest, most terrible failure: Account access settings, or moreso the lack thereof. Let's say you have an HSA. Let's say you have 2fa activated on that account, or perhaps you've updated your password. Mint, when I had this happen, pinged that account 20 times in a row, every hour or so. Locked me out completely. It was a month of back and forth, proving I was who I said I was, reassuring them I wasn't being hacked, until I could get access back and even then I still had issues with being locked out if I entered my password wrong even once. There's no option in mint to set how often, or if, it should re-query an account automatically or simply notify you of the failure and wait. Honestly, knowing it can't get into an account would have been a great feature to help protect against unauthorized access (IE, someone resets your password to steal your account).

I said ""some budget is better than none"" up above, but the problem is that, because of the interface, the bugs, the issues, I never really ended up using it beyond the first few months of struggle.  I'd occasionally log back in, try to update something, have it bug out, and log out. Editing the buckets was a convoluted process, editing basically anything in it was awful. It was all the bad of a spreadsheet (IE, gotta know exactly what does what, no guidance at all) with the worst of an online tool (low functionality, no customization, everything must be done the one way that management and marketing decided and the programmers interpreted).

**Deleting Mint:**

It's not easy. Technically, I still have a ""Mint"" account because it seems, according to their FAQ, that to delete mint one must delete their entire Intuit account and history. I still use Turbotax, so I'm not going to delete Intuit entirely. And I know I still have the Quickbooks stuff from my time moonlighting with Lyft.

What I did do was go through, account by account (after finding where the list of accounts was - hint, it's buried under the left side menu, not the ""+accounts"" button at the top), and delete them. Big huge warning messages over and over warning that it would delete the entire account history. You have to type ""DELETE"" every time to confirm. Then I went to manual bills and deleted those. Assets, deleted those. All the way down to ""0% setup"". Then to notifications and disabled all of them in Mint. Then the intuit account settings and disabled all emails there, because it's different. And finally logged out and deleted the app from my phone. Is that everything?

461,t3_gf19sw,"So here's the thing. I am single and I live at my parents in Barcelona. I know for the US 26 is very late to move out, however in Spain it's not strange at all to move out in your late 20s. I guess it's a matter  of both culture and economy. Anyways, I graduated late from university due to personal matters, and after having a 22k €/year job I finally got to find the current one where I make 3250€/month net.

I have talked with my parents about moving out (I have a great relationship with them), since I have many questions related to economic matters and how to optimize my money, and they are of the idea that renting is wasting money, throwing it away. Specially my dad, he thinks that by staying home with them a couple of years I can save up to 80k € and maybe try to buy a home then (a house, not an apartment, can be usually around 300-400k € at minimum in the suburbs of Barcelona). Now, it's indeed true that I would save up to 80k, which would be really great, but I would be 28 soon to be 29 by then, and honestly, while it might not be strange in Spain, I don't see myself living with my parents until almost my 30s. They sustain I don't lose anything by staying home and in the other hand I save a lot. I really value their input since I need lots of advice at this point of my life, but I disagree with them, and I don't know if I should really act on what I feel (go and live on my own) or stay and save a ton (which would be the rational choice).

In Barcelona, a 1 room apartment can be between 800€ (the super old ones) to 1200€ (the semi decent ones). I'm talking about 30 to 50 m2. I have the following table with approximate monthly expenses in Barcelona.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

|Renting|1000€|
|:-|:-|
|Gas, electricity, water|50€|
|Transportation|40€|
|Food|150€|
|Internet and phone|40€|
|Media|13€|
|Personal Expenses|150€|
|TOTAL|\~ 1450€|

So out of my 3250€/month incomes I would be left with 1800€ (almost 2000$) of savings per month, having around 22.000€ in savings right now after april's salary. I am really torn between staying and saving a lot or moving out and save way less.

I don't consider living with roommates to lower the rent. I think that if I am to move out it would only make sense to do it alone with all the freedom benefits, otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to me and I would prefer to stay home and save money.

What would you do in my position? What would you be your train of thought? Do you think it would be better to stay or would you move out? What are the things that you would base your decision on? 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

PS: I was also thinking that if I'm to move out, it would be good to wait for around September, since due to coronavirus the prices might decrease. It's hitting hard in Spain and the economic predictions coming from Europe are really really bad for us, so prices might go down later this year.","When to move out? 26 years old, 22k € in savings, making 3250€/month net (around 3500$), and 0 debts.",r/personalfinance,0.57,1,1588861558.0,3,0

To keep things simple, I'm planning on taking a two-year's sabbatical after college to devote my time to researching select subjects that interest me in-depth and without distraction. During this time, I also plan on building a competitive case for attending an esteemed school to obtain a master's.

I plan on purchasing or renting a plot of land with two structures in the middle of a preferably colder low-maintenance area, with one structure being a designated living space and one being a designated research space. I do not plan on buying anything nice, as I just need a reclusion spot. It would be preferable to not have any unavoidable issues with the structures. I would like to have central AC and reliable electricity.

I have recently been looking into locations such as TN, GA, MO, NE, and NC. I would like to be located near a small town, as socializing helps me ground myself and libraries are useful to me.

Vices include alcoholism and occasional depressive episodes due to social stagnation.

* My current estimated annual spending is \~$15k.
* My current estimated annual take-home is \~$25k.
* My ""FI"" estimated annual spending is \~$8k. This doesn't include home purchase/rent as I have not decided on a place yet
* My current fixed asset NW is \~$10k. I plan on liquidating at least half of this before I go ""FI"". Investment value is fortunately not fluctuating due to the pandemic.
* My current liquid NW is \~$2k.
* Due to scholarship, I will not have outstanding debts post-graduation.

Should I rent or own? After the sabbatical I wouldn't mind converting the structures into passive income somehow.

I turned 33 this year and as I get older the more I'm over the apartment life and want to get into a house. 

**Finances:** 

* Make 50-60k a year as a freelance film maker. 

* Credit score isn't great (Low 700s). Mainly due to some high balances (when your job is your hobby it's easy to overspend). Right now sitting around 15k.

* Have about 5k saved.


* Currently paying ~$1,000 for an apartment. 

* Have a SO, but am not counting her income - seems like a failure point that's easily avoided. If things are still good at that point, her money can be the cherry on top for some upgrades.


* The Houses I like seem to run 200-250k currently.

So that all said, what do I need to do to get there in the next 3-5 years? Aggressively paying off my credit cards is goal number one for this year and perhaps into next year. That should boost my credit score, I had a high 700s last time I had my credit card almost paid off. Parents have excellent credit and would almost assuredly co-sign, though I'm trying to do this on my own if possible.

Finding additional revenue streams and growing current client base is always a priority and business has grown by a modest amount year over year, with the exception of last year (2018 was a crazy good year, 2019 was more in line with the trend line).

What should I be aiming for with a down payment? I've seen 3.5% for FHA loans, which would be around 9-10k. Alternatively the traditional 20% number would be around 50k - which would help me avoid PMI correct? I don't think that's an unreasonable swing for a 3-5 year timeline. Especially if I moved back with my parents (they would legitimately love that and have offered it several times) to save the ~$1,500 I spend in rent/utilities.

Anyways, when you certify for your weekly benefits there is a checkbox that asks if you want federal taxes taken out of your unemployment insurance benefits. I check ""yes"" every week. However, since the $600 federal boost has been applied, the CA EDD only takes out $45 instead of $105. 10% of $450 is $45. 10% of $1,050 is $105.

Thus, every week I get $1,005. This is problematic because I don't want to owe the IRS anything on this income and would prefer to have them take it out before I even see the funds.

Just last week, I printed out IRS form W-4V (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4v.pdf) which is a Voluntary Withholding Request, and mailed it to the EDD along with a short cover letter stating that federal taxes are only being deducted from the ""base"" amount, not the COVID-19 $600 additional boost and that I would like 10% withheld from the full $1,050.

My mother in law and her husband are signed up to go into a nursing home sometime in the future and they don't want ""medicaid to take their money"".  This already makes me feel uneasy since they are basically avoiding the costs of the nursing home with their own assets so that the government/taxpayers will foot the bill.  My wife and her sister in law will be the names on the trust.

**IRA, transfer or keep?**

Anyway the lawyer that they are working with said it was a ""gamble"" with my mother in law's IRA.  If they shift that $200,000 over to the trust then it is penalized and taxed heavily (not sure why he would even recommend this) since it will no longer be used for an individual's retirement spending.  But if they don't transfer the IRA to a trust, then if/when they go into a nursing home then they will have to first use that IRA money before using medicaid.  Again, this makes me feel uneasy because of the capital gains taxes, income tax and penalties.

**Gifts and 5 year period**

There is also the 5 year period where they can't make too many moves with their money.  They could gift money (IIRC the limit is $15,000 without gift tax) to my wife each year and I believe in their state every $6500 that was gifted means a 1 month delay in qualifying for medicaid.  Any thoughts on this? Is it better to gift each year and take that penalty instead of transferring the IRA? Seems like it is.

**How will this impact my wife? What should we look out for?**

My wife and her sister-in-law are signed up to be in the trust.  So they would be giving an ""allowance"" to my mother in law and her spouse since they won't own anything on paper.  Is there anything we should look out for since my wife's name will be on the trust? Any tax implications while the money sits there idle?

I have a car loan through NFCU, and it works as one would think - I pay extra and it's reflected automatically on my overall balance.

My mortgage, however, is through Union Savings Bank, and it's a great rate but a hot mess.  For starters, let's say my mortgage is $1200 per month, due on the 1st.  If I get some extra money and decide on the 10th to pay $400 extra, it sits in what they call a ""suspense"" account doing nothing.  I literally have to call the bank and ask them to apply the $ in ""suspense"" to principal.  The only way I can pay extra is only if I pay a ""full"" mortgage payment - anything additional over the $1200 gets applied towards principal.  It's pretty annoying.

If I were to refinance my mortgage with NFCU - if I wanted to kick in an extra $500 once in a while, does it immediately (once credited) show the updated lower balance, a la my NFCU car loan?

With Federal loans being on administrative forbearance, all interest rates have effectively been set to 0% from March 13 - September 30; meaning no minimum balance is due. (https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus)

With that in mind, you are able to direct your entire monthly payment (or less - no minimum balance is currently due!) towards one specific loan, opposed to how it would normally distribute your payment across all of your loans. You can target your highest interest loans right now, and pay them down.

This will lower your overall interest rate once the forbearance is lifted.

*Currently on the Federal student loans website, www.studentaid.gov, interest rates are all effectively marked to display ""0%"" - which can make it difficult to determine which of your loans carry the highest interest rates.

I got lemonade insurance since 2018. It has always been on a card until January-ish 2020 where my credit card expired so they sent me a new one. As a result, payment does not go through &amp; they requested I update my payment info -- fair enough.

So I did that. And the same day I received a fraud notification (2/6). I cancelled my credit card and disputed it. I distinctly remember it was the same day as my Lemonade payment because the person over the phone made a comment about it. Didn't think much until it happened again today.

* **EXPENSES:**
   * **$300** a month health insurance
   * **$67** a month for student loans (LOW bc my salary wasn't this high the previous year).
   * **No rent payment** I work remote so I travel and in the interim, stay at my parent's house.
* **DEBT:**
   * **$116,000** student loan debt through Navient, with a 0% interest until 9/30 (due to the epidemic) Interest rates for Navient are typically between 2.88% - 7.25%.
* **CURRENT FUNDS:**
   * **$13,000** in my bank account
   * **$9,500** invested in ETF/stocks on robinhood (**11%** total return as of today)

Now that I have a high salary, and not a lot of expenses, I want to be as systematic and responsible with my money as possible. The recent financial advice I received was as follows:

1. **Start paying as much as I can towards my student loans until they're gone. Pay close to $1,000 a month and pay them off in the next 5-6 years.**
2. **In my current bank account, I have a travel account and a savings account, with a combined total of $7,000. I was advised to put ALL of this in the stock market or towards my loans.**

I am newer to finance, but I always had the mentality that I should just pay the minimum on my student loans until the day I die, because why not? I figure why would I take away from traveling or make sacrifices now if I could die tomorrow? I'd rather use my money towards what I want to use it for and pay the absolute minimum on my debt.

However, the conversation today reminded me that even if I think that being this much in debt isn't bothering me, I'm sure that subconsciously being in the negative doesn't feel good for me. I want to feel empowered, I want to be debt-free. But, it feels counter-intuitive to take away from my bank account- it takes away what currently feels like safety and stability.

She was offered a saving plans in UDIS with an small interest, but since she's an American citizen I suggested her to invest in an account in USD with a high rate of interest, especially since that **money won't be touched in at least 5 years**, I think an account with an interest over 3% will make up for inflation and the initial transfer fees.

548,t3_geisjm,"I am a synchrony employee and have been following closely the disaster relief benefits the company is offering. They keep changing these and have been trying to add an automated way to handle it. But that broke and so we are starting something different today.

Starting today (and I can't guess how long) Synchrony Bank is offering LATE FEE WAIVERS and INTEREST WAIVERS on accounts at all due stages. In addition if your account is less than 4 months behind then they will offer what they call a REHAB; wherein they make the account not due for payment during the current billing period, and remove the late fee or interest you have been charged (This process also reports to the credit bureau that a payment was NOT MISSED).

All you have to do is call in to collections and say you have been impacted by Covid-19. We DO NOT try to verify this. We won't ask for any proof or etc. Just call and say you have been impacted by the corona virus and they will let you know what they can do.

If your account is current: We will waive interest and set it so you don't owe a payment this cycle.

If you are 1, 2 or 3 months behind: We will waive interest and late fees and make it so you don't owe a payment this cycle.

If you are 4+ months behind: We will only waive late fee and interest.

In addition to this if you are on a no interest payment plan and it is going to expire in the next 30 days we will extend it. 

BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE CALL!

I don't know how long we will continue to offer this. Please, please, if you need help (or want to take a little off the top) call Synchrony Bank today!

Edit: I realized it’s worth noting that we can only speak with you about the account or a spouse. This process can be performed by the collections department only with you or a spouse. So you can’t also call in for your mom or have them call in for you. And in some states we legally can’t speak with a spouse in your behalf.

Update: Today as of 10am eastern time we have started using the automated system to perform these updates. We press a button and it makes the decision for what it waives it’s rehabs. So far I haven’t gotten it to waive someone’s interest. So that window may already be gone. I would very much encourage you to still ask for help and mention the corona virus because that will let us do something. But far less than we were doing yesterday. :(

Update again: Here is exactly what the automated relief package does:

No minimum payment due for next two statement cycles, no late fees charged for next two statement cycles, any deferred interest promos set to expire on that period will be extended til September, no autopays will pull since nothing due, YOU WILL STILL ACCRUE INTEREST.

This isn't nearly as good as what we were offering yesterday since interest is going to still be charged. But it should still help people who need a little relief.",Synchrony Bank Waivers!,r/personalfinance,0.82,17,1588795739.0,16,0

565,t3_gey2y3,"I recently did some research on best online bank accounts and signed up for one with Radius. I plan on keeping my immediate liquid savings there, as above a $2500 balance accrues interest (forgot what rate) and i can wire transfer from bank to bank easily and it appears to be free. I just scheduled a $1.00 test transfer from radius to my main bank acct and recorded balances to see if its truly free.

Well, the question arises bc i have a current Edward Jones savings account with 2500 - 3500 in it. I thought it was neat at the time, because you can take a loan against the account, receive the cash, and yet the account continues to grow in the market at the full amount of shares, not less shares since i pulled money out of it. And i could make up my own payment schedule back. I used it once, it was nice. 

But surely there are higher fees overall with Edward Jones and i'm better off pulling the money out and reinvesting. 

So heres my brainstorming and please add / improve where you can. 

Radius will be my immediate savings account and also how i achieve free ATMs now the few times i ever use it. I'll keep, say, 10k in there, at 2500 it is interest bearing and i typically never need to dip into savings beyond the comfort margin i build into my budget. Edit- 10k will cover approximately 6 months of Bill's if I reduce my mortgage payment to min payment on the 15 yr note. That's where the number came from.

Beyond that, i can probably devote an additional 500-700/month into long term retirement savings.

I used to have a vanguard roth IRA, it seemed to be less fees and hassle for a do-it-yourself kind of deal. But had to wipe it out along with all my other savings, had a near bankruptcy. 

I would think an IRA would be a good place to start because 5500 maxes it out per year correct? So around 475/mo or so would max out my contributions toward it. Any reommendations on where to establish a new roth IRA or something better?

What about a second priority for long term, low fee or hassle (read edward jones) savings?  Are CD's still a competitive option these days?

About to turn 30, back in school to get my bachelor’s degree (in who-knows-what). My parents have been custodians of a 529 account ($35K) and a UTMA account ($16K) in my name. Recently, they transferred their assets to a capital management firm. Quite suddenly, a phone conference was scheduled to discuss the transfer of the aforementioned accounts to my possession. My mother texted me the meeting minutes less than an hour before the meeting, where a representative from the capital management firm explained the process:

* My 529 plan will be changed to a “Utah” 529 plan (due to lower fees)
* My UTMA accounts will be liquidated at a loss ($4K; used for tax purposes), then reinvested with the capital management firm.
* My parents are helping pay expenses I cannot afford (car insurance, rent). Instead of selling off their own stock, they will gift stock to me which I will then sell to pay such recurring expenses, paying zero tax on the sale of the stock because of my income bracket.
* A small monetary gift from my late grandfather will be invested with the UTMA funds.

To make a very long story short, my parents and I have relationship issues. They’re accustomed to disregarding my autonomy and making major life decisions on my behalf, frequently to my detriment. In the conference call, it felt like I was being pressured to follow a plan concerning my life that I had no say in. Aside from this particular anxiety, I have several concrete concerns that would be more wisely addressed by consulting a 3rd party:

It claims that i used 75,000 cubic feet of water...over 560,000 gallons in half a year, or, 3,600 gallons a day.

I just went outside to check my water meter's current reading, which the bill is only 5 days behind on.

Meter reading on April 29th, according to the bill, is 188,000 

I went outside and today on May 5th, the meter shows 202,890. That means i used almost 15,000 cubic feet lf water in about 5 days? That's impossible. 

3,000 cubic feet per day...over 6 gallons EVERY MINUTE. A hose running at full blast. Surely I'd have flooding somewhere?

The city I'm in is hard hit by Covid, and cannot reach anyone at the water department. What do i do?


EDIT:
I did some testing. My outdoor meter has not budged in usage for 6 hours.

My indoor meter went up by 15 cubic feet in almost 4 hours - no a lot, considering we did 3 loads of laundry, washed the floors (2 stories), and cooked dinner. I purposely calculated usage to the most it could possibly be. If we did this for 24 hours a day for 180 days non stop, it would still be 1/4 of what they claim we used.

I had a financial and personal crisis (divorce/foreclosure) many years ago the likes of which I actually didn’t really think I would have recovered from.  But I did, and against rough odds, better than ever.  (New amazing wife, best career year ever, I’m sober, happy yada yada... etc.) 

To the point: I have a little under 20K in student loans that went into default and was picked up by some sort of student loan collection agency/ management. I’m able to pay them off in one fell swoop, but I was told that it’s “smarter” and better for my credit to enroll in a “federal rehabilitation program” - the reason being, that if I write a check and pay them off, it will always be shown on my credit report as a “default that was paid off,” and reflect poorly...but....if I enroll in this “federal rehabilitation program” it will take 10mos of consecutive monthly payments, then add the benefit of permanent removal of all default reports - and is therefore “better.”  This is a federal gov program of some sort I’m told?

Does anyone have any insight into this?  Or can advise  the actual best move?  I’d have thought it’d be better to pay in full and wipe them, but I’ve been told the “fed rehab program” is better in the long-run, for credit.  Optimal credit health is great, but the real goal is get this balance paid. 

Further details - the woman who told me this was indeed at the collection agency - so could be an ulterior motive to have me in a longer, higher interest-bearing term rather than get a check all-at-once to satisfy?  I tend not to think so, usually people want to get paid, but possible as collections are frisky.  Further - I could pay this off myself with my own savings, sure, but have been offered a family loan with zero interest and exceptionally kind terms for repayment, like $1000 per year, as a “glad you’re back, now re-start with no debt and rebuild your credit, kid...”  (I don’t think this matters but I’m just being transparent in case it may, and someone here knowledgeable thinks this could fudge with taxes or etc.).","Student loans: went into default years ago, can pay off now in full - but better for my credit to “Federal Rehab Program?” and pay monthly?",r/personalfinance,1.0,2,1588828209.0,14,0

I got approved for a 2.75% interest rate but was told that I didn’t meet the criteria requiring me to recoup the closing costs ($8,100 around) within 36 months. I was told that I would be able to qualify with this loan if I could bring $9,000 to closing. My loan officer also brought to the table a loan with an interest rate of 3.00% which she could roll in the closing costs into the loan and would be recouped within 36 months. She said that the loan with the 2.75% rate is being charged a 1% origination fee and the 3.00% loan is not. I asked if I could bring the difference between the two loans around $2,000 to bring the lower rate closing costs down to meet the 36 months. She said no this was no an option. I asked her why one loan was being charged an origination fee and the other wasn’t. The origination fee in the 2.75% loan is essentially causing me to not meet the 36 recoupment criteria. She said that these fees are decided by her marketing team. I am not understanding why I cannot bring the difference of the closing costs to the lower rate.

588,t3_gew8e8,"I've been following the subreddit (amongst other similar ones) and I feel like I have very basic investing knowledge, but when I realized that I know almost nothing when it comes to all the possible strategies/techniques that are out there to maximize your potential net worth. I guess I just want some general life advice in this area from people who are more experienced/knowledgeable than I am so I hopefully don't make the same mistakes or other common ones. I don't want to make fatFIRE my life either, but I think it's smart to try to get at least the easy things in order and not make any major mistakes.

Anyways, I'm a college student graduating this year (21) and have been able to fortunately secure a pretty well paying job, especially for right out of college (\~250k+).

I'm invested around 8k in the market like a year ago and it's worth 11.5k right now, which isn't that bad, although before this year the market has been performing well so I could have just gotten lucky. I'm mainly invested in tech because it's what I know best. A lot of it was newer SAAS products or tech tools (like MongoDB) that I picked up because I saw their value as someone familiar with the field before they blew up. I think I returned like 150% on both MDB and TWLO. The others generally returned from -20-30% to +30-60%. My worst investment was Wells Fargo that's down 55% right now and arguably it was a bad investment because I didn't know much about it and just wanted to diversify (along with following people who said it was undervalued). In a way I'm glad it wasn't successful though because at least now I know not to do that anymore and it hasn't been that costly and I probably would just think I'm super smart if worked out.

I have a Roth IRA set up with around $1500 in it too (literally bought ZM stock with all of it when it first IPOed, again because I was familiar with the scene, but in terms of it blowing up, I would have never expected that). I have a traditional IRA set up too but nothing in it yet (or maybe the minimum? Either way it's not invested in anything yet if I have money there, I'd have to check). I know a lot of people mentioned HSA's being better than both too?

I know the general advice is 401k match -&gt; HSA -&gt; Roth IRA -&gt; rest of 401k/Traditional IRA right? What do you do after?

I also know almost nothing about the housing market and how you would take advantage of opportunities to be successful there. Do you need a large starting capital? I know the general concept is you buy property when mortgage rates are low and rent it out (I think you have to pay a fee to some management company here?) to people who in turn pay if off for you. Then from there hopefully the property has gained value and you can keep renting it out or sell it.

Also I know there's ways to minimize taxes in general, and right now I realize I'm paying (or will be paying) a ton of taxes, so any advice on learning more there?

Overall, do you think there's a good chance I can fatFIRE or even FIRE in my situation and what would be the best path to get there from my situation. I know a lot of people here have started their own companies, created successful SAAS products. that they sell off, etc. but I guess my life just seems a lot more ""normal."" I suspect at best I can get around 300-350k comp by 25 and hopefully close in on 500k by 30, but I'm not sure I'll ever be able to increase beyond that (especially since I don't want to dedicate my whole life to just making money).

589,t3_ges5tn," Hello - I have a situation that I am hoping to get some input on. Below is a summarized version with a lengthier version at the bottom if you're interested.

\-I defaulted on a payday loan from Loan Till Payday in Delaware

\-Loan Till Payday says that that the debt was sold to Rocky Mountain Capital LLC

\-Rocky Mountain Capital LLC does not have my SSN/name under their system

\-The debt does not show at all on my Experian credit report

\-Myself (and family members) received a call from a “private locator” trying to serve me papers unless I contact the firm handling it

\-They gave me Global Financial Inc LLC to contact about this

\-Global Financial Inc LLC says I need to pay the debt right away or the “private locator” will serve me papers at my house

\-I mistakenly pay $200 and agree to a payment plan with them and they claim they’re filing a continuance on my behalf (and they’ll waive the “$200 locator fee”), but as far as I know I haven’t been put in any legal situation to date for this. They can’t explain who the private locator company was looking for me nor can they tell me the courts that they filed any continuance with. They just state that I have to pay them the full amount and I’ll get a paper that says I paid it all that I should hold for “the rest of my life” (their words).

\-I saw red flags based on things I read on the below link that is very identical. When I got the payment agreement it came from a Secure Pay LLC which was a different company all together and Global Financial’s address on the e-mail document is in California. This address is a UPS store.

\-When calling out the company individual (Matt) I said it seemed odd that they didn’t have proof they were authorized to collect on this and I had concerns and mentioned a lot of the above (plus more) and he told me I’m “snowblinding” (does not seem like the right term to use at all, but I have it recorded it and he says it) their company and he’s going to report me to his management for wasting his time. He goes on to say if I don’t want to keep paying then I could get served papers and they’ll try to get me for involuntary dissolution on fraud in the inducement of a contract. I don’t even know what that really means.

\-Ultimately I know I have a debt. I want to pay that debt, but it seems like I’m not paying the right company (they also continually say they’re a “firm” not a “collection company”) for this debt, but I’m concerned how they’d have my info. They even said “if we have all your information then you know it’s the right company otherwise we could just take all your money” which seemed like less of a defense of them and more of a red flag. I just wanted some input if this sounded suspicious even in the world of collections.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long version:

Hello All - This is a little lengthy, but I am hoping that I could get some input on a potential payday loan collection scam. A very brief background - I have battled through a gambling addiction over the last few years and am in active recovery for the better part of the last year. Previously when in my addiction I took out a $950 payday loan from a company in Delaware named Loan Till Payday. I made a few payments, but because of my addiction unfortunately eventually defaulted on the loan. I wanted to pay it back, but financially couldn't afford it because of other debts, losing my job because of my addiction, etc. I am now working again and am slowly paying back my debts that have went to collection companies for things like personal loans and credit cards. I had not heard about this payday loan going to collections yet, but I knew it was inevitable and would handle when it did so as the lender had said they were not going to accept payment anymore so I knew it was a waiting game until it crept up.

Fast forward to yesterday - I get a call from a man identifying himself as Adam. I answered because the number is my area code. He said he was a private locator and he was going to be coming to my house to serve me papers (and wanted to confirm my address, which he already had) unless I had talked to the firm handling it and settled it. I asked what this was in regards to (not realizing at the time it's the payday loan situation) and he said he couldn't tell me but the firm should have called me. I said I received no call and he played what seemed like an exaggerated act of ""oh jeez. I can't believe this! They should have called you. Please call them ASAP as I'm going to be at your house in 45 minutes"". He gives me a number and says to call them and reference a specific claim number. At this point I'm not thinking too straight and get concerned as I literally just started a new job last week and don't want anything to side track me from that, but know I need to address this. Before I can even call this firm my wife informs me that she has gotten a message from this ""private locator"" (and I eventually found out my father and sister did too), but all of the calls to family members happened before the call to me.

So I call this firm (the automated answering answers as ""Global) and get on the line with an individual named Matt. I ask what this is in regards to after giving him the case number. He recites my name, address and SSN (without me giving them) and asks if this is me. I say yes and he explains it's regarding a $2,400 debt with Loan Till Payday. Now I know I took a $950 loan, but there was expected interest on that (plus late fees) so I assumed that was an accurate total. He says he can help me and call off the locator serving me anything, but he needs to make sure I didn't receive any paperwork yet because after I do so he can't help me. He says that he can wipe everything if I pay the $2,400 right now and goes ""so please read the credit card number when ready"" before I even decline paying $2,400 right now. I stated that I could pay $200 and that I'd like to setup payment plan moving forward. He says ""Good news! If we do that I can waive the $200 locator fee we were going to charge you"" which seemed bogus, but I was afraid. I paid the $200 and agreed to pay $200 bi-weekly until it's paid off in September. He said the transaction is under Global Financial Incorporated, LLC and would be on my credit card as ""GFI FINANCIAL"" (which it was). I asked for a payment agreement and he said it'd be sent to my e-mail (which they also had the e-mail I signed up using at the payday loan company) in the next 24-48 hours, but a different department handles it and he'll expedite it. He says they'll contact the locator and issue a release order and won't come serve me papers as long as I keep making the payments.

At this point I feel a sense of relief because I've straightened out a payment plan for a debt I regretted having, but as the day progresses it doesn't sit well with me and I start to see a lot of the red flags with what happened above as I'm sure you may while you're reading this. I start looking up Global Financial Incorporated, LLC in terms of collection agencies and don't find much. Then I found the below thread regarding a Mutual Financial Partners out of Arizona that seemed like they were doing the same sort of process in 2013 that Global is doing here. I then call the number of the locator back and it picks up with a message stating ""You have reached the investigation line. You cannot leave a message."" and disconnects which seems even more odd. I know I have a legitimate debt, and I want to pay it, but I start getting concerned that I'm not paying it back to the right people.

[https://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-888-337-3514](https://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-888-337-3514)

Once I see this forum above I get very nervous that this company is going to drain my card so I decide it's in my best interest to cancel the card I paid with. I did not immediately flag the transaction as fraud since I did authorize it, but I needed to stop this potential fraudster company from taking anything more until I got further confirmations.

So this morning I decide to call Loan Till Payday and flat out ask what happened to my defaulted loan as embarrassing as it was. They said it was sold off to Rocky Mountain Capital LLC. I asked Loan Till Payday to confirm the exact sell off amount of the debt as I wasn't sure the amount of interest I accrued so for all I know the $2,400 isn't accurate. Of course they didn't know the exact amount.So I call this Rocky Mountain company and they have no records of receiving anything under my SSN or my name, but they do sound like a legitimate collection agency unlike Global. I call a different Loan Till Payday location and confirm I have the right collection company and they say I do so now I'm even more confused.

At this point I still haven't received the payment agreement from Global so I call this Matt back again. He states it's still be prepared but I'll have it today. I start prying asking how they obtained this debt, asking if they're authorized to collect on it, etc. and he says I'll have to wait to get the document before I can ask any questions and if I'd like to expedite it I'll have to speak to his supervisor. I asked to speak to his supervisor and he hung up the call after a quick transfer music played. I waited to see if I got the document and I did later this afternoon. The document outlined the following:

Dear XXXXXXXX

,The proposed resolution for repayment is as follows:5/4/2020 - $206.00 (Paid), 5/15/2020 - $200.00, 5/29/2020 - $200.00, 6/12/2020 - $200.00, 6/26/2020 -$200.00,7/10/2020 - $200.00, 7/24/2020 - $200.00, 8/7/2020 - $200.00, 8/21/2020 - $200.00, 9/4/2020 - $200.00, 9/18/2020 -$200.00AS LONG AS YOU ADHERE TO THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE, WE WILL DEEM THIS DEBT AS SATISFIED IN FULL.ALL PAYMENTS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR BANK STATEMENT AS GFI LLC. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDINGYOUR FILE PLEASE CONTACT THE OFFICE AT 844-400-6514.SINCERELY,GLOBAL ADMINISTRATION

THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT, AND ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

There was mention of Loan Till Payday on the document too with the $2,400 amount, but didn't indicate much else in terms of their authority to collect on this debt. What was odd was the is a UPS store according to Google.

Then another red flag came up which was it was sent from the following e-mail address: [customerhelp@securepayllc.com](mailto:customerhelp@securepayllc.com). I was curious what Secure Pay LLC was so I looked it up and it's a different company, but coincidentally they're located in Tempe, Arizona which is also where the company, Mutual Financial Partners, mentioned in the above hyperlink from 2013 are located.

I now call back Global and get Matt again. I say I have some concerns about what is going on and need to know how they obtained this debt to collect on. They said you can call Loan Till Payday and they'll tell you we got it which I obviously did earlier and Loan Till Payday did not give it to this company. I said it was sold to another company and he said that it was probably a company in Maryland (missed the name), but that's also not true as the Rocky Mountain company it was sold too isn't located in Maryland. I asked what the locator company was that was going to come to my house and he said they contract out companies to the local area. I tell him where I'm located and ask what the company was to which point he says it's not his department who handles it, but it's probably completely random. He says that because of my $200 payment yesterday they filed a continuance on my behalf so I am in the clear. Well as far I know I haven't been sued by anybody as I've received no notice, but they stated they filed the continuance with the courts. I asked who filed what and what courts they're filing it with and he told me I'm asking too many questions and another department is handling that piece.

He goes on to say I just need to pay the payment plan as we go on and then I'll get a paper saying I paid in full and I just hold that ""for the rest of my life just in case"" (his words, not mine). I ask where he's located and he says Los Angeles but has no specific address. I then begin to pry about the address on the letter being from a UPS Store address, the domain address on the e-mail being from this Arizona company, the payday company not mentioning their company, etc. He begins to tell me I am doing way too much digging that I should not be doing that as he believes I am ""snowblinding"" their companies and nobody has ever traced the detail back that I have and that it's not necessary. He said that I was wasting his time and he would report me to his management. He then said we could settle this all today for $1,400 which I obviously did not give him. He then went on a guilt trip about how I took out a loan, owe a debt and it needs to be paid back to them which I agree I need to pay it back, but to the right people. He then kept advising they're a ""firm"" not a ""collection company"" and they're just trying to help me. Went on to get more hostile saying how would they get all my info if they weren't the ones who needed to be paid, called me ""man"", said ""I'm not his friend and this just needs to be resolved"", called me by my last name and said he didn't need to preface it with the Mr. in front of my last name, etc.

I ultimately asked him to speak to his supervisor which he replied ""I'm done arguing with you. I don't get what you don't understanding. Have a good day young man."" and hung up. That was my last communication.

I know this was long winded, but I was hoping for some feedback if anybody has dealt with any of these companies mentioned or just this situation. I know I have a debt, I own up to that debt, but I don't think that this company is the true collection company. Who the debt really sits with is still a separate mystery since Rocky Mountain says they don't have it and the loan company says it went there, but I don't want to pay this Global ""firm"" another cent until I know it's legitimate and there's too many red flags that it's not legitimate, but how would they get my info? I can see getting my name, address and even family member's names, but how would they get the loan company, my SSN, etc.? I'm just extremely puzzled because it's not all adding up. I don't want something worse to come of it, but really don't feel I'm proceeding down the right path with this company. I've dealt with collection companies before, their tactics are brutal and manipulative, but nothing like this. Either this company is legit and as slimy as they come or this guy (and whoever is working behind him) are extremely good fraudsters.

I think my wife and I have done well with our investments but the vast majority of our savings is not liquid yet I am now knowledgable enough to look at some investment properties. We have about $200k in equity in our primary residence with 26.5 years left on the mortgage at 3.65%. The property should appraise for somewhere around $400k or slightly higher. I was considering a cash-out refi given the low rates and maybe sucking $100k for a ""rainy day"" and shoving it in my MM account.

593,t3_gew4ha,"Hey PF -

I received a significant raise today that puts me in the danger zone with my Roth IRA contribution. Previously, I was making $100,000 with a 10% yearly bonus, now I am making $125,000 with a 10% yearly bonus, which puts me at $137,500.

I currently max out a traditional 401k and a Roth IRA. I also contribute $6,100 a year to an HSA on behalf of me and my significant other. My company contributes the remaining $1,000. This puts my MAGI at $111,900, which is still fine in terms of contributing to a Roth IRA.

*However*, I read through the majority of the comments on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/gdvsii/how_common_are_roth_401ks/) today that really piqued my interest. I've always felt that mixing up my contributions between my Roth IRA and my traditional 401k was enough, because you never really know what will happen with taxes, but I feel like after reading through this, my view point has changed a bit. I ran some numbers using [this suggested calculator](https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/ret10), and maxing out my Roth 401k as opposed to a traditional 401k would increase my income by almost $2k a month in retirement. According to that thread, **Roth is only beneficial if you plan to max out your Roth 401k.** I do.

So here are my questions:

* If I were to switch to a Roth 401k for next year, I'll be sitting at $131,400, which leaves me with $3,100 to contribute to a Roth IRA. Does this prevent me from doing a backdoor Roth? What are the logistics? Could I still just stash $6,000 in a traditional IRA and then convert, or does it need to be broken up into $3,100 and $2,900 chunks?
* Probably a stupid question, but if you convert a backdoor Roth IRA every year, do you just have a million Roth IRAs lying around? Can you roll them into each other? I'm still fuzzy on the details of this process.
* Finally, and most importantly, if I do plan to continue maxing a Roth 401k and IRA, am I putting myself at risk by not having any traditional retirement investments?

594,t3_gevyo1,"I’d like to get your guys opinion on the Golden Butterfly portfolio presented in this article [here](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/all-weather-golden-butterfly/) from Listen Money Matters for younger individuals. I’m not an active listener but I have heard some of their content in the past but I missed this. It wasn’t until my friend asked me if I had considered it and I had to have him explain what it was. He knows I’m a risky investor with my short term money but my IRA is basically a copy of the All Weather Portfolio around Ray Dalio’s theory.  

My friend’s idea is that since he is young, starting with 0 invested dollars, and wanting to create a way to live off his investment income in retirement, he thinks the Golden Butterfly would provide stronger returns in the long run, especially since he would be starting to invest next month when the market has already taken a significant hit from its all time highs. While I told him the timing of the market does not matter as much, he still believes that since he is so young, the Golden Butterfly would produce more returns with less risk since the market has more good days than bad and he’s hoping to have a lot of days left ahead. 

I’ve done some research on it and it does seem to make sense to me. If we die of old age, with all the advancements, average life expectancy may be nearing the 100s by then. My thought is we could always start with Golden Butterfly and then rebalance to more of an All Weather once we get older since he said the all weather is an “old man’s portfolio”. I disagreed since I’m heavily invested into this “old man’s portfolio” already but I do get why he thinks that.

Not sure if the is the appropriate sub to post this, but I know you guys collectively have WAY more experience than I do in these matters and I trust the opinions I see here. I’ve just been overwhelmed with a lot and need some sound advice, suggestions, opinions. Okay, so here goes: 

I’m 29M, living in rural Canada. Last summer I lost my mom to cancer. She was diagnosed in early 2016, a few months before I graduated Uni. I had moved home prior to that in order to save some money/pay off some debt, but after her diagnosis my plans drastically changed. I was her primary caregiver those past 4.5 years. I took on a seasonal job which paid the bills, and allowed me to be home to support my mom. Myself and my brother have inherited our family home. I was named executor, and am just coming to the end of that whole process, and
 have been staying at said home. Administration of the estate should be completely said and done by late summer/early fall, at which point I’ll be in a position to finally ‘do my own thing’. 

The job I’ve had these past 5 years is in no way related to my degree (it’s a trades job), so while filling out resumes I really have no ‘transferable’ experience for the past 5 years. Also this job is no longer an option - I’m unemployed now (since March) and even if I /wanted/ to go back, the pandemic situation has basically done away with that option. This problem (career change) is compounded also by the fact that I live in a fairly rural area, and the available opportunities are very limited. Another option is grad school to upgrade my skillset. What I would study and where, I have no idea, but it’s either that or finding a decent job for the time being. 

The most appealing option is to move - either to a Canadian city or elsewhere for more opportunities. But, that leaves the house. it’s not exactly in an ideal renting location (not horrible, but not ideal) and it’s not yet really in a saleable condition (if we sold it right now, it would not be worth nearly what its true value is). 

Another issue with moving to a whole new place is debt: I have about $40k student loan debt, probably around $10k credit/autoloan debt remaining. Another is the current pandemic situation - when it will be possible to move, and what job opportunities will be available at that point in time, I have no idea. 

Anyway, I know this is a bit disorganized, I’m writing on my phone, and feeling overwhelmed. I really appreciate any kind of input. :)",Complicated situation - getting my life back on the tracks,r/personalfinance,0.8,3,1588815233.0,5,0

I work in a big and ever changing team in a hospital. We usually run a tea and coffee kitty - everyone puts £2 per month in and whichever schmuck finishes the milk has to go to the shop and buy more.

Now the hospital shops have gone cashless. So far people have been taking cash from the kitty and paying from their personal contactless accounts, but I was wondering if there's a good long term solution.

626,t3_geu7a3,"Hi PF&lt;

As the title says - a close family member is going through a terrible time. They were hit with a 500k garnishment from the government for a judgement from many years ago. The family member is the sole provider for the household and is in their 50's with about a 250k salary. I am not aware of how much the government is going to garnish from their paychecks, but I do know they seized all financial assets as of today which was around 80k in cash bonus allocated this year and another 40k in retirement accounts.

Unfortunately, they have to pay taxes on the retirement account seizure and cash bonus forfeiture. There could be credit applied to previous forfeited assets, but I am not really counting on it, and that matter is being worked out through our attorney. I have used methods like debt snowball to get out of 100k in student debt myself, but given this persons relative age, income, location (high cost of living area), and responsibilities (sole provider), I am having a hard time even comprehending a 500k debt reduction strategy that would get them out of debt before 60+.

**This person is the most important person in my life, so I am determined to help with this burden.** I've listed some general things I've thought of that I would like to present to this person. See what is the best route and start diligently chipping away. I don't know - what - if anything I am missing from the list. If someone has tackled a high amount of debt like this I would love to learn more - even if you just tell me to look at your post history.

Debt Reduction:

* Outside of really focusing on a budget that eliminates most discretionary spending.
* This person has no personal debt and does not own a home.
* Figuring out a cheaper area to live that is respectively as close to work.

Additional Income:

* Some strategies I've thought of would be telling the two dependents they need to get jobs - stat - to detach financial burden there.
* Sell off anything they can.
* They are an expert in the field that they work in - i've suggested consulting to provide additional income. They could get some part-time clients that would increase their yearly income by about 50 to 100k.
* Another idea to generate income was to start a side-business that me and the person would run concurrently - I would use the revenue generated to pay their salary as a contractor.

Expenditures:

* Use a software like YNAB
* Potentially hire some sort of financial coach, CFP, CPA to help them stay on course. I would pay for this so it wouldn't be a burden to them.

Hey, Reddit! I’m needing to move in July and am looking for a new apartment. Most apartments in my area (Dallas, TX) require 3x rent as an income, and for my roommate and I that means we would need a combined total of around $3000/month. They all request 3 months of paystubs, starting with the most recent.

My roommate remained employed during this whole mess and makes ~$2200/month post tax. I on the other hand was furloughed from two jobs (substitute teacher and restaurant host), went on unemployment, and now pull in ~$2400 a month on unemployment. I am starting at the restaurant again next Monday and am looking for a second job, which means I’ll have an income of at least $1600 a month starting next week. I made $3000/month in January, February, and March.... it’s only April that was solely unemployment income.

The school district still lists me as employed by them and I am expected to renew my contract in August, they just have no need for substitutes right now. The restaurant listed me as employed as well in April, but the doors were literally closed so I couldn’t work.

Long story short, is unemployment income something that apartments will accept as “income”? Did COVID change anything, as this was declared a nationally big deal? I could get a guarantor but my parents are retired and they would need to make “6x monthly rent/month” at most places around here.... not sure how to get around that? 

Is there anything I can do to circumvent this issue? I can’t stay at my current apartment, they require 4x rent to renew and we don’t pull that in anymore; my roommate started grad school in January.

630,t3_gepi5z,"TLDR: save more for retirement in 401k or roth IRA or put all money into paying for law school in a year?

I'm 24. I will start law school in fall 2021 (deferred admission to a top 10 school--I'm not willing to change where I'm going for various personal reasons). I should make around 60k in the next year provided that I don't get laid off. I have no debt beyond the ~$200-500 I charge on my credit card and pay off in full every month. I live at home and spend around 10-15% of my income on expenses (doubt I could get this much lower), saving the rest in a mix of a HYSA, CDs, 529, and 401k + roth IRA. 

I have a 50k scholarship for law school and with the money I have saved up, I anticipate borrowing around 110k. 60k of that will be at 6.08% and start accruing interest immediately, while the remaining 50k will be at around 7% (this is presuming I'm using government, not private, loans). My plan is to borrow the max unsubsidized for year 1 (~20k at 6.08 interest rate), max unsubsidized + what I need for year 2, and whatever I need for year 3, though I was trying to figure out if I should just skip borrowing for year 1 even though it's at a better interest rate. 

After graduation, I intend to go into a government position and will likely initially quality for my school's loan repayment assistance program/REPAYE/IBR/PSLF or whatever. My starting salary will probably be low (60kish) but could grow to at least 90k and up to 120k within 5-10 years. I have no plans to have children or buy a large house or have a large wedding.

I currently have around 2.5k in retirement savings (just started saving for retirement this year). My family thinks I should stop contributing to my roth IRA and my 401k (no employer match) asap and just put it in CDs or a HYSA. Does this make sense? Or would the lost compound interest likely mean that contributing a bit now would be reasonable?

The big X factor is this: I have a chronic illness. I can currently work full-time but there's a non-zero chance that I'll become so disabled that I cannot work at an unknown point in the future. I don't know if that changes the risk/reward calculations. The other factor here is that my health insurance costs during school will likely be higher (I'll be 26 when school starts), which I've accounted for when estimating how much I'll have to borrow.

My wife and I both have a Fidelity Traditional IRA, each with some $7000+. They were (solely) funded in Feb 2019 with excess 2018 Roth contributions re-characterized as traditional IRA contribution.

I am currently enrolled in a professional MBA to help with my career progression. It is a local state school that will cost me about $28k + books and fees. I already have a full-time job and will be doing this part-time and my employer will reimburse me the $5250 a year to go to school.

I will be taking summer courses to finish in 2.5 years so what I have calculated is that I would need:

Year 1 (2020): 7418 - 5250: 2168 Summer &amp; Fall 2020 (9 credits) 

Year 2 (2021): 12,504 - 5250: 7254 Spring, Summer &amp; Fall 2021 (15 credits)

Year 4 (2023): 5086: 0 Spring 2023

So total out of pocket expenses would be $16,676 give or take depending on fees and books. I know I will be accruing interest immediately but I am not too worried about that. Obviously I also have to pass the class and will be enrolled in the next one before I get reimbursed for the first class and that is part of the reason for the loan.

I have some money to pay for this but was offered a student loan for the Summer and Fall, the summer I received 7844, and I received the full amount for the fall 20,500 federal unsubsidized loans. My company is quick on the turnaround for payment so my plan was to take the tuition for the summer, then when I get reimbursed used that to pay off the loan, and continue to do so as I go throughout the program. As well as use any extra cash to continue to pay down the loans until I am hopefully close to zero by the time I graduate.

I have a few questions: 

Should I accept the full amount and use that to pay the entire tuition for the program and pay it off as I go along? I figure whatever they don't use can apply to the next semester's tuition, is that a wrong way of thinking?

Should I adjust the amount for just the tuition for each semester and keep applying for the federal aid each year if I need it? I only really need the tuition and that may be just the first year as I have been saving up to pay out of pocket, but still have some debt to payoff.. which is why I am borrowing this money now.

I am 50k in student debt and have 6k in savings and 5k in recent prize money. Debt interest is currently frozen but am not sure for how long. My credit is 750.

I'm 36. I have no debt. I rent and plan on buying a house in less than 3 years. I own my car and, after some minor maintenance, it's in great shape.


My take home pay is appx 42k annually. Living expenses, needs, wants, etc equal about 50% of that. The rest goes in savings. 


Savings is appx 17k. I'd like to keep 12k for emergencies. It's a high yield savings account. 


401k is appx 16k and is set to 6% with company match.


HSA is self funded with appx 3550. Will contribute max each January.


Roth IRA is appx 11k. Will contribute max each January.


TLDR: take home income less bills and expenses is 21k less Roth IRA and HSA is appx 11k.


My idea is to keep the above plan, save 6k for a 3% down payment on a house in a separate high yield savings account, and invest additional savings (beyond the emergency fund and home down payment) in a mutual fund. It will be in there for many years. I'm not interested in active trading.

- The property is for sale at 85k, what would my income need to be at minimum to purchase this property to be approved by the bank? 


- My credit score is 700-720, will that help me when getting a loan? (I’m only 20) 


-I use my local credit union and I plan on getting a loan through them, or should I use a big bank?

647,t3_get20p,"Hello all, I need a bit of advice on which loan to pay off. 

I have about $78K in cash (not my savings) in the bank. I just refinanced my house at a low rate and got some cash out to pay off one of these other loans.
 
_

Loan 1: 

I owe $61K on a personal loan. I pay %3 fixed on this loan. I get no write-offs at all. It is part of the deal with my friend the lender that I don't get to claim any of the interest on my taxes.

_




Loan 2: 

I owe $77K on an SBA loan from 2010. It has for the most part been at 8% for the life of the loan but is somehow at 5.75% right now (I assume it will go right back up in the coming years). I no longer use the property I purchased with the funds for myself and I lease it out. 

_



I can't really figure out what makes more sense for me. 

I understand that I could pay off loan 1 and still put $16,00 into loan 2 so I am comparing rates just based on $61K for both. 

I would be paying $30K in interest if I paid off the personal loan, and I'd be paying $15K in interest if I paid off the SBA. It seems like a no brainer to pay off the SBA, but is it a bad idea on the tax write off for interest?

651,t3_geokxz,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

my girlfriend and I both work in financial services in NYC and are subject to employee trading policies that put restrictions on what we can investment in. My question is not what to invest in but rather which vehicles or solutions might be available that are not restricted and that I have not thought of yet. Would appreciate answers from redditors who are also in the industry and can speak from experience.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically in order to buy either stocks or mutual funds/ETFs we both have to get approval simultaneously. While that itself is not necessarily a huge act, having to do this manual step each and every time we want to put aside money for long-term investments is annoying and, which is the trigger for me to post here, led to us having money just sitting in our checkings account. We are already putting money into savings accounts for short-term goals and our checkings account also serves as an emergency fund but I dont feel comfortable having &gt;10x monthlx expenses lying around in cash.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the purpose of the policies and I have no issue with them. I am not looking for ways around the policies but solutions to adhere to them while investing (a portion) with as little maintenance as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I am looking for an easy investment solution that does not require us to seek approval every time we shift money into it. Originally I am from Europe and there it was fairly easy to set up a savings plan for mutual funds or ETFs with my broker that would not fall under standard employee trading policies due to being a periodic investment (which takes away the timing component and thus makes it an investment rather than trading). At first glance it seems like this is not acceptable here / with our current employers. Still have to check in detail.

&amp;#x200B;

But what alternatives do we have? First thought was to check the eligibility of robo advisors (e.g. Schwab intelligent portfolios). Still working on that. What else should I check out?

Hope you're all healthy and happy. I Desperately need some legal guidance and I'm hoping someone can help. 

I am located in Virginia. 

In January I had a credit score of 816. 
Today I checked and my credit score is 699.
It's a huge fall and I was shocked. I immediately checked my credit score because I always pay everything on time religiously and I figured maybe it was a mistake.

Turns out that a doctor who I went to see for my annual check up 3 years ago charged me 140$ that I never paid and they sent it to collections. The collection agency is called Radius Global solutions.

The reason I didn't pay it is because the doctor insisted on a certain blood test which I told her I didn't want but she said it a part of the annual checkup which was free and covered by my insurance. She even ""double checked"" and said it was 100% free/covered. Two weeks later, I received a bill of 140$ for the test. I called her office and emailed her saying I never wanted that test and I am not paying for it. This was three years ago. 

Apparently last month,  Radius Collections reported my non-payment and now my score went down 117 points over $140??!!! How is that possible?? I'm so heartbroken. 

This will gravely affect me and my ability to secure loans.
Can someone please help me? Has anyone ever dealt with
Radius Global solutions? The Original debtor is LabCrop America. 

This is my first time dealing with something like this. I went out of my way to pay all my credit cards in full every single month. My Car note is even pre-paid in advance every month.

I am 24 years old and I have accumulated \~44K in debt over the years, the break down of the debt is as follows

$20,000 in student loans (4 years of college still not graduated)

$9,000 owed to the University for a semester I lost my financial aid.(Lots of health issues) This is my priority debt atm due to wanting to finish my degree and get a higher paying job. I only have 1 semester left.

$9000 in various collections due to CC, Old Cell Phone I got for my mom, My mom's utility bills I let her put in my name so that she could have electricity.( I basically let my parents trash my credit at 18/19) and Eviction in my name for an apartment my mother lived in and Medical Bills.

$6000K owed to car loan I got repoed.

My credit score is 390( can't go much lower tbh)

As far as options I have thought of

\#1- File Bankruptcy Chapter 7 and erase all debt except student debt which I can work on after I graduate. I'm already living without credit and luckily found a landlord that doesn't run credit checks and works with me. I own a cheap cash car and have no assets. Talked to a few area lawyers the cost is about $1200. None of them are sure if tuition is dischargeable since its not technically a loan so that is up in the air with this option either way.

\#2 Let the Collections fall off. The only one really likely to sue is the Car company, the rest are pretty small individually and relatively old if they were going to sue I think I'd have been warned by now ( again I'm not sure).  I haven't accumulated any new Debt since 2018 so in 5 years most of these will fall off.

\# Debt Settlement working with a debt settlement company and disputing the debts that aren't mine and settling the debts that are. I've heard paying collections doesn't really improve your credit but I'm not too educated on the matter, the lawyers I and people I spoke with about bankruptcy didn't seem too interested in talking to me about options. 

I'll be 25 later this year and my goal is to be out of debt (minus students loans obviously,) by the age of 30 and have a credit score at least in the 600s. I'm planning to by then have a career as an RN at that point. I currently make about 25K a year.

Here are the accounts I currently have open:

* Roth IRA w/Charles Schwab (I max this out every year)
* 403b Annuity w/AXA Equitable (learned about its high fees after signing up)
* 403b Mutual Fund w/PlanMember (my school added this as an option after I opened the AXA account, and I have been transferring in 10% of the annuity per year to avoid penalty from AXA; \~1% expense ratio)
* Before-Tax 457 Account (learned about this last, but it has a lower expense ratio of .15%, so I have stopped contributing to the AXA account and contributed to this instead)

Remaining loan balance is $355,473. Rate offered by local originator is 3.325%, with 0 pts, new loan would be $362,000 - about $500 cash out of pocket to close.  Currently rate is 4.275%.

I think we would be better off with a lower payment/rate locked in and overpaying the $333 towards equity when we can but the option to not need to if things get tight.

1. Childcare (full time daycare is $1,500 per month)
2. Support for Mother-In-Law (on SS/Medicare, we pay her $1,200 per month rent and she helps with Childcare.  This is to keep her from being homeless.)
3. Student Loan Debt service - about $1,000 per month.

We don't carry any other debt, but due to a late start in life we are both trying to maximize our 401(k)s and did not have the cash to put 20% down on the house, which we felt we needed due to having a child.  Having a child was a ""shit-or-get-off-the-pot"" situation due to our age.

1. Debts get settled faster since lump sum is available to FDR for negotiation.

When Covid hit the fan, I started to look for other jobs, and just got offered one with a big tech company! There are a lot of tradeoffs, and I'd like some help thinking about this through financially:

Job #1: Director of Operations (current role)

Salary: $64,000/year (though usually it is $80,000 - we had a pay cut, which will continue for the next few months)

Schedule: It was a typical 9-5, but since March I've been working crazy hours, no set schedule, kind of working whenever is needed b/c of the virus.

PTO: 15 PTO, 5 sick, 3 holidays (Christmas Day, New Years Day, Thanksgiving)

Medical benefits: shitty benefits but I'm on my partner's health plan ($25/month)

401k: none.

Stock options: none.

Other perks: I work a block away from my apartment, discounts on high-quality food/meat, the allure that comes from working for a well-known NYC-based restaurant group. Most of my coworkers are great.

Other downsides: my direct supervisors are our two CEOs, who aren't the best managers. Not sure what the future of the restaurant/food industry is going to be like. Small company where I've already reached the top. Having to go to work and not quarantine.

Job #2: National Operations Manager (offered the job)

Wage: $39/hour, potentially eligible for overtime.

Schedule: 2-11 pm, Sun-Thursday. Working remotely 'indefinitely.'

PTO: 13 PTO, 8 sick/wellness days. 1 floating holiday to use. Can take some unpaid time off if needed.

Medical benefits: good insurance, but not as good as the plan I'm on now. Going to waive them.

Stock options: Offered 5,000 shares on a 12-month vesting schedule.

401k: no matching, but at least a 2% pre-tax contribution per pay period.

Other perks: $20/day Seamless credit, catered lunches when office is reopened, pre-tax commuter benefits, upward mobility in a well-known tech company. I think the product/platform this company makes is very cool, and the team seems very intelligent. Direct manager seems very smart, seems like a good leader. 

Other downsides: working 2-11 pm could be tough, especially when the office re-opens. Not great PTO but not that dissimilar from my current job. Having to commute \~20-30 min for work when the office is open again.

**Some background:** I'm 25 years old working as a Mechanical Engineer at a large manufacturing company in New England. I've been living at home with my parents while trying to pay down student loans and save money for a house. I've lived here my whole life and commuted in college. As grateful as I am for my parent's generosity to let me live with them rent free I feel like I need to get my own space.

I'd like to stay in the area as I love my current job and see myself staying here for the foreseeable future. ""Starter"" houses (WWII era, 2 or 3 bd/1 bath / ~1000 sq ft) are selling in the $160-220k range. I am hoping to find something in the $175-190k range.



Onto the numbers: 

**Base Pay: $70k/yr**

**Savings: ~$23k**

**Stocks: ~$6500**

**Student Loans: ~$71k left ($45k private @ 4.51% + $26k Federal @ 3.9%)**

**Auto Loan: ~$7000 @ 3.99%**
******
**The Breakdown**

**Take Home Pay: ~$3950/mo** This is after hitting my employer 401k match (6% from me / 3% from them) 

**Student Loan Payment Minimums: $220 Federal + $500 Private** 

**Extra Private Student Loan Payments: $350/mo** (Actually $500/month, but will drop when I find a house)

**Food/Toiletries: $350/mo**

**Car Payment: $225/mo for car and $143/mo for insurance** (I am planning on selling my stocks to pay this off this summer to free up cash flow)

**Phone/Life Insurance/Gas/Subscriptions/Misc: $288/mo**

This leaves me with ~$2000/mo left over going up to $2200+ after I pay off my car this summer.

*******
Like I stated at the top of the post, I am looking for a house in the $175-190k range with a max budget of $200k. I plan to put 5% down which would put the mortgage + property tax at ~$1025-$1150/month. Add in ~$75/mo for PMI and another $100/mo for homeowner's insurance and I'm at $1200-$1325/month. Using numbers I got from friends/family I'm figuring an additional $300/month for utilities in a small house (heat/electric/internet/water).

**Total:$1475-$1600/mo**

*******


All that being said I would have ~$550-$700 left over at the end of each month. What I want to know is: **Is this enough?** After buying a house I should still have ~$9-10k left in my emergency fund which would give me a 3 month safety net.

My full year salary would be over the limit for direct Roth IRA contribution, but, since I only made a stub year salary, I was under the amount. In fact, I was at an amount where I can make a deductible IRA contribution.

What I did was made an IRA contribution and then converted to Roth through the backdoor, realizing later this was unnecessary. I did this in February 2020 for the 2019 year, with my understanding that the 2019 tax return would indicate on Form 8606 $6000 in lines 1, 3, and 14 (and no Part II), and the 2020 form including $12,000 on Part II lines 16 and 17, with $0 on line 18.

To make things more complicated, my IRA contribution can actually be deductible based on my income for 2019. I suppose my question is do I \*HAVE TO\* deduct the IRA contribution, or can I not deduct and proceed with the Form 8606 plan for 2019 and 2020. And if I do have to deduct the IRA contribution, what would the effect be on my 1040 of the conversion from traditional to Roth taking place in 2020 even though the contribution was for 2019?

I've  had 2 brokers look into my credit for pre-approval eligibility  currently (one in MA and one in NH as we were looking in both areas. We  chose NH.) and don't plan on having the NH broker pull again until end  of May or June, per their suggestion. I was also told by my NH broker  that odds of us moving by our desired end date are pretty good provided I  get my credit up a few more points. When my credit was last pulled on  04/13, the middle of my 3 scores was 591, the higher was 620. Here's  what I've done so far since then:

1. I  had a loan that I've been working with National Debt Relief on settling  and paying off.  I'm about to graduate from their program on 05/28 and  the settlement will be paid.
2. I  have a credit card with a $10K limit that was up to a balance of $8k  when my credit was last pulled. I've managed to get the balance down to  $5,700 since then and will have it down to $3,700 or less by 06/25.
3. I have another credit card with a $500 limit with a current balance of $230
4. I have another credit card with a $400 limit with a current balance of $40
5. I have another credit card with a $1k limit with a current balance of $480

706,t3_geqwl1,"I've read the wikis regarding investing at my age, windfalls, and other topics. While they have been generally helpful, they deal a lot with paying down loans and making retirement contributions - the assumption seeming to be that those exist. I am fortunate enough to have very limited expenses and practically no debt. I also do not have a full-time job. These factors combine to create what I think is perhaps slightly more unique than the wikis detail.

With that said, here's the breakdown:

* 20-24yo college student with part-time employment (2.5 semesters left)
* &lt;$4500 owed to parents' (my only debt)
* &lt;$1000 fully liquid
* Budgeted expenses amount to cost of living minus rent/insurances plus spending cash
* \~$25k foreign inheritance, pre-tax/fees

My plan is to pay off what I owe, keep 10-20% in cash/savings, and invest the rest with most going to equity securities and some debt. These would be personal portfolio investments and not through retirement accounts. Now for the questions:

1. Should I be investing via (Roth) IRA instead?
2. Is an allocation of 65/35 for equity to debt securities too conservative?
3. Should I continue with installments or just lump-sum the debt?
4. Would it be more prudent to apply that towards a house or graduate degree, assuming similar timelines for beginning?
5. General thoughts on using some of the funds to take time off after graduation - most likely in pursuit of a non-traditional career.

Just a quick rundown of my pregnant girlfriend's situation..

She was separated from her first husband for more than five years. They just officially divorced early this March which would make her eligible for special enrollment at her job. The thing is that the insurance won't accept her because her ex-husband dropped her off his insurance in January and its been over 90 days. She's a teacher so enrollment is in August which then goes in effect in September.

The question I have is how expensive is it for the first 3-4 months of being pregnant? Would it be worth having her enrolled in another type of insurance until she can sign up at her workplace? She said she went to the Obamacare website and received quotes for around $300+ a month. So it would be around $1,200 total.

Am I better off paying out of pocket until then?

I live in NYC and I’ve been helping my parents file for unemployment. Things were going fine for the first two or three claims, they got direct deposited just fine. Suddenly we got the Key2Benefits card, so that week I reentered the direct deposit information but the money never came (even though the website says the funds were released, I also activated the card and set up the account for my parents anyway). Called my parents bank where they had the direct deposits directed to, absolutely nothing they could do because they didn’t see any incoming money or anything on their end. The following week, the claim was automatically switched and paid out to the debit card. I was busy, so I put off immediately going into the Key2Benefits website and transferring the funds to my parents bank account. Filed the claim for this past week, money got paid out again to the debit card. I finally go to the Key2Benefits website and there’s... no money. Nothing at all. The transaction history and card activity is completely blank. No money ever came in or went out.

My dad owns a small business and his accountant does his client's kid's taxes (aka my taxes) for free since they're not super complicated. So for the past few years I've just sent my tax documents over and that's that. This year was the same, except now I had lots of forms to send rather than one or two. That is usually the extent of my interaction with the accountant. 

He \*finally\* filed/finished last week. (I sent documents over mid-March.) When I was reviewing my record of account in the IRS website for 2019, I noticed that there was no amount shown for the 'Student Loan Interest Deduction'. I paid about 1.5k in student loan interest last year (1.3 federal, .2 private), so if that deduction was applied, my return would be almost $200 higher. 

What steps do I need to take to correct this? I e-mailed the accountant a few days ago, but he has yet to reply. Can I fix this myself? Or would I  need him to resubmit? 

Bonus: I also noticed that the Tuition and Fees Deduction was empty. (paid around 10k for this last year) Can someone confirm that this field is irrelevant to 2019 taxes? I'm 99% sure that it's only applicable to 2017 and prior years, but I've seen some conflicting info when researching.

1. After some research, I can't find a guide as to what blend I should do being so young. I am open to risk, I just want a balance. I just want some insight here.
2. Am I correct that I can cash this out when I buy a home, free of penalty?
3. Is it worth doing 5% contribution vs 3% (6% vs 9% - given my terms of cashing out in a decade tops)? (No calculators online are accurate/adequate for my calculation purposes).

Despite being praised with the highest possible score during each employee review, I'm constantly treated poorly and unprofessionally by my managers and a big chunk of other employees at my company. I'm treated as lazy or sometimes a theft, despite having emails and more as proof of task completed. Other employees treat me like a joke, almost to the point of calling it trolling.

Point is, so much has happened to me that I've become depressed with my job and thus my life(shitty apartment doesn't help)

I technically have a healthy savings built up that could keep me somewhat secure for a couple months, but I'd prefer to continue saving and investing what I can for my future -- but staying at this job has taken a real toll on my mental health and personal life.

However, I handle all of her/our finances (with her blessing and desire, she doesn't like dealing with money). This year we are finally ahead on everything and starting to save. 

I'm building up a savings account on my end and making sure that we divvy up her portions of money into her savings account so she has liquid money for emergencies without me. I also want to get her a credit card for small monthly bills to build her credit, as I am the only one with a credit history. I'm making sure sure she understands money and is able to be independent without me if something happens.

So, as an unmarried couple, what are my best options to make sure our finances are transparent/accessible to eachother?

I wouldn't want to joint ALL of our money, but I feel like there is use in having a couple's /savings/ account. Or maybe a savings account and an account for bills. That way we'd both have access to it in emergencies and for bills.

If we get a joint account as an unmarried couple, could that be used to legally bind us on taxes etc? If it does, what is another option?

If something happens to me, how can I make sure that she has access to all the money I have in my personal accounts? If something (forbid) happens to her I'm fine with her family soaking up her liquid assets, but I am /very/ worried that if I am unable to consent my money may be untouchable to her. I don't have family that I'd like to shade money with, or debt, so I want to make sure it goes to her lol.

$160 a month for cell (I pay for my sister and I)

$150 a month for private school loan at anywhere variable interest that anywhere from 9-11 percent. Interest only payments until next year then it'll be $580 a month. 

$30 a week for gas

$45 a week for a hobby of mine 

$60 a month for insurance

$75 a month for government school loan

$75 a week in my savings

$100 a week spending money

The plan is pretty much to stop contributing to my roth, pay my bills at the beginning at the month, and put any extra towards the $15,000 at the end of the month.

Would it be a good idea to take the money out of my Roth and put that towards the private loan as well? The interest on the loan is higher than what I am getting back in my Roth so a figure it might be better to just pay it down.

My wife and I have been in the progress of purchasing a new build home since before Covid really was making an impact in the US. The more we talk about the house with people, the more varied the opinions get. Some people are saying they think we should pull out now since the economy is looking grim and lose our earnest money. Others think now is a great time to buy because interest rates are low. 

Here’s the details:

585K house (we live in a very expensive area)

We’re likely going to get somewhere around a 3.1% interest rate without buying it down 

We were planning on putting 5% down and paying PMI (either paying off PMI upfront or paying monthly payments)

We have about 70K in accessible cash (other money is all in retirement accounts)

My company just went through a big round of layoffs but I did not get laid off. I’d give myself around a 15% chance of eventually being laid off if Covid continues affecting the economy. 

Our mortgage would be about my wife’s total income.

With both of our incomes together, the mortgage is about 35% of our total income. 

We have put 5K down in the form of earnest money that we can’t get back.

We met with an Edward Jones financial advisor and decided to place $5000 into a joint brokerage account; I also maximized my 2019 Roth IRA contribution with $6000. Both accounts are under Edward Jones' Guided Solutions program fee, which charges a 1.35% annual fee on the first $250,000 in the account.

We did this with the notion in mind that it is better to get started somewhere with investing than stay paralyzed by choice and inexperience. 

Thinking ahead, I'm wondering if there are options for investing that would reduce costs and allow for more growth in the longterm. I read some posts from this sub from several years ago of many folks switching from Edward Jones to Vanguard for lower costs (and participation in mutual funds that have lower expense ratios--I'm a little shaky on my understanding of expense ratios but know it's important). I'm wary of taking on a DIY approach because while I feel confident in my ability to learn more, I would prefer an approach that relies on established expertise, is lower stress, and has comparable returns.

Here's the relevant FAQ answer for repayment:  


&gt;A “lump sum” repayment for the total missed payments is not required immediately at the end of the COVID-19 Forbearance period. However, your lender will then evaluate you to see what loss mitigation options may be available. If you are an owner-occupant borrower who indicates they have the ability to resume making on-time mortgage payments, and were current or less than 30 Days past due as of March 1, 2020, you may be eligible for a COVID19 Standalone Partial Claim. A partial claim is a no interest, junior loan secured by your property. No payments are due on the COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim until the payoff, maturity or acceleration of your insured mortgage, including for the sale of your Property or a refinancing, or the termination of FHA insurance on your mortgage. If you are not eligible for the COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim, your servicer will evaluate you with FHA’s other loss mitigation tools to help you repay the balance owed over time.

I interned in a financial planning practice, joined them full time after graduating with BA in finance. Spent over five years studying for licenses, passed the CFA, passed the CFP while gaining experience in the financial planning industry. After 5 years and all those exams passed, I was promoted to be an FA. I was proud.

What is disheartening is the widespread negative perception of financial advisors. I have worked incredibly hard studying and working in the industry. I felt like the bar I personally needed to meet to feel competent giving anyone advice on their life savings and finances was very high. I will always seek to learn more so I can offer sound advice to people.

However, popular opinion can make it seem like my career is a sham, my long hours and dedication were a complete waste, and I am really no better than a petty theif when you think about it. Of course, you have to ignore the negative noise. But it's always there in the background. 

I believe people's lives are, in part, a sum of the decisions they make. Sometimes big important decisions, other times small decisions that add up over a lifetime. If I do my job right, my assistance in these decisions makes a real difference in people's lives over time. It might be a financial difference, a quality of life difference, or both.

I don't understand the perception that this career makes me corrupt, or just a salesman in a suit. Personal finances are very important and I am trying to be a reputable and competent resource for those who seek it. I have dedicated my career to it.

My question is: would it be smarter to put money towards saving for a down payment on the car and then car payments while my student loans are in forbearance or make minimum payments on the car and focus on student loans instead?

So, here's the situation, I am 25, living/working in southern california making about 120k. I have about 30k in a savings account currently. Besides bills/rent, I owe about 26k on a car that's worth about 30k and no other debt. Besides some RSUs, I don't have anything in the market or my 401k. In about a year, I expect to have about 50k saved up. I work in tech as a software engineer.

&amp;nbsp;

The deal is, I am burnt out. I've been working basically non stop since I was 17, never had any real vacations and worked summers as well. Worked all throughout college and started working immediately after graduating. I don't hate what I do, but I don't love it. I feel like I wake up and just work, eat, go to sleep, wake up and repeat. I do some fun stuff on the weekends, hit the beach, drive the car, hang out with friends, etc... but it's not enough. I am not happy, and besides the very brief periods where everything is cool, hanging out with friends, talking shit, I feel like I am dead inside with no real goal or purpose. I don't know if it's depression or not, but I am leaning towards not. I've been depressed before and that was different. When I was depressed, I didn't even want to leave my room.

I finally have a decent income, paid off all my student loans and credit cards, have an excellent credit score, but so what? This was the end goal? I don't give a shit about moving up the corporate ladder. I am so fucking tired of the politics and the passive aggressiveness of people. I just want some honesty which seems damn near impossible to get. I've read dozens if not hundreds of posts similar to this one across reddit and I guess I am adding to the pile. 

There are a lot of different things I want to try and do to see if I can make money on other ways. I would like to try creating content on YouTube/Twitch, photography, blogging, writing a book, limited traveling and whatever else comes to mind. No, I am not fixated on any of these but I want to TRY. If you're thinking what's stopping me from trying now, the answer is mental exhaustion. I can't pretend that I get physically exhausted from sitting in front of a computer all day, but by the time my work day is done, I want to turn my brain off and that's exactly what I do. 

If worst comes to worst and my savings starts running low, I will start applying to jobs when I have about 3-4 months worth of savings left. I don't think it will be too hard for me to find a job in the tech sector again. I also don't mind working minimum wage jobs either which shouldn't be too hard to find either.

So, now that I finally got that off my chest, I want to quit. Quitting now seems stupid, I am grateful that I even have a job while so many millions have lost theirs, I am practically unaffected. But in about a year, I want to quit. I don't mind waiting until the current situation dies down and the future is a bit more clear on how the world will rebound from it.


1. What happens with health insurance? Does quitting count as a qualifying life event? Do the health care subsidies include assets in the calculation of my premiums or is it solely based off of income? If it's income, is it based off of taxes?
2. If I am looking for a place to rent, can I leverage my high credit and bank balance to sign a lease? I guess worst case, I can probably prepay a certain amount if not a full year. 
3. If I sign a year or two year long lease while I still have proof of income and then quit my job, is is considered fraud if I don't notify my landlord that I quit? Could I get kicked out? I fully intend to pay my rent on time.
4. Is it advisable to get a 0% credit card, put most things on it (if those still exist after the financial mess we're in) and only pay the minimum as a way to create an additional buffer of finances? I think with my credit score and income, I should be able to get a card with 10-20k limit at least. Would I need to notify my bank that my income has changed?
5. Any other things I would need to consider if I were to do this?

808,t3_gelj8x,"Hi all! Thanks for reading. My dad was asking me for advice about this but I'm not fully certain so I thought I'd ask you all before giving him any info.
 

They currently have about $280,000 left on their house which they pay $2,000 per month (so about 140 months). They also have $66,000 of credit card debt where they pay $1,000 per month, which is their minimum. They then transfer it to a new card each year, paying a 3% flat interest on the value transferred and no further interest that year. 
 

 
They received an offer to consolidate all these loans into one payment of $2,000 per month for 180 months using the house as collateral. So the new lenders would pay off the rest of the house and essentially refinance the house at a slightly higher (but reasonable for the house) value. The interest would be fixed rate at 3.25%. This would raise their total debt from about $350,000 (house and credit) to $365,000 including interest, and their payment period from 140 months to 180 months. That being said, they intend to use the $1,000 they would originally use to pay their cards every month to pay the new loan, thus increasing their payment per month on this loan to $3,000. This would reduce their payment period to 122 months (the loan has no penalty for early payment). If my math is correct, this would require them to pay $330,000 total, thus reducing their original debt by about $20,000.
 


Does this make sense to do? My dad is the only one who works and he is about 12 years away from retirement. I don't want to give them bad advice but as far as I can tell this seems to make sense as long as they are actually able to contribute the full $3,000 per month to their new loan (which I believe they will be able to.)

I had purchased a round trip flight to Germany back in November last year to travel this March. When March came around, Germany banned travels for non-EU, non-healthcare persons. I reached out to United for a refund, and they denied the refund and issued a flight credit valid until November 2020.

I was dissatisfied with the future credit that I thought I probably couldn’t use anyway because who knows if COVID will be gone before November 2020, and wanted actual money back. So I filed a dispute with Chase immediately.

April some time, United allowed everyone to exchange the future credit to an electronic travel certificate, valid until November 2021.

Now that it’s valid until November 2021, I probably COULD find a use for them and would’ve taken that as a refund. But since I already filed the dispute, I didn’t bother canceling the dispute.

A week ago, I got a letter from chase saying that the dispute has been resolved in my favor. I was credited my money back. The future credit for the entire amount is also still in my United account. So here, my questions are three-fold:

1) Is it common for merchants to come after me for the charge separately? Will it go to collections if I don’t pay? In my 20 years of having a credit card I’ve actually never filed a dispute and don’t know how this works. 

2) i read that airlines can blacklist you if you do a charge back against them. It’s a bit too late to worry about that now I suppose, but is this the case? I was assuming a lot of people were probably doing chargebacks.

\- Should I convert to a LISA (or at least open one?)

\- What would likely happen if a Labour govt. was elected in regards to the funds in my LISA verses if I kept them in a HTBISA?

In 2017, I took out a $2500 federal loan when I filled out my FAFSA application, I dropped out of school shortly after, and I haven't made a payment since (stupid, I know, it completely skipped my mind until I tried applying for a paypal credit card somewhat recently), and now I owe around $3000, I also owe the school itself about $7000 now (originally owed $5000)


I recently ran a credit report to find out why my score was so low, and the only thing that shows up is the $3000 I owe for the federal loan. 


I'm not sure how I go about fixing this. Should I make payments on it through edfinancial every month or should I apply for a loan to attempt to pay it all upfront soon?

My father passed away (RIP Dad) and left me with some rental property and cash outside of the United States.

The property has been poorly managed for the last few years when my father was sick and will need some renovations and new management (another story). But, I am estimating (conservative) that it will generate &gt; $30,000 USD/year after salary &amp; bills are paid. The property is paid off. The bank account associated with the property has ~$100,000 cash in it which I now control.

Up until this point, I have been financially supported by my parents for everything with direct cash. My mom told me to take the property and money and use that to support myself from now on. This is more than fair and I am extremely grateful for position I am in.

I was fortunate to get a scholarship for medical school. After scholarships, my school fees are about ~$20,000/year. So I will have to pay ~50k from this point till I finish (2 and half years left).

My monthly expenses are ~$1,600 (rent+food+bills). 

I have ~3k cash in my account here but I'll have the financial support of family till I sort this out.

I have no debt.

I am not sure where to begin.

Should I even bring the money to the USA? What about income generated? Where do I put it? I don't think it's generating much interest from looking at the statements. I would leave at least $20k for renovations.

First - 598 credit score, basically  over 100k in debt mostly credit card some of which is in a debt consolidation loan because I was dumb in my 20s and had medical issues. I also have 8k in payment plan over next year to IRS as well. My wife and I traveled a LOT before 2019 and honestly we were classic millennials having a good time. I had a good job that was supposed to pay out bonuses and had a healthy paycheck. Lost it during a reorg and spent most of 2019 freelancing before our wedding. Should we have canceled the wedding? I would have liked too but it wasn't really an option. We wound up having it, it was the best day of my life, and moved to my new job, at my dream company, the following week. 

How I'm living now - solid for now, we don't eat out anymore, my only entertainment expense is spotify and youtube tv. Food is about 750/mo, rent is 1500 inc utilities, no car, no fancy shoes or clothes, no travel for next 1.5 years (here's the thing, with COVID it's not going to be affordable to fly or travel so our honeymoon is probably never gonna happen or happen just here in the US). I have no assets. Most expensive thing I own is my laptop which is used and would sell for 600 bucks. Phone is 70/mo. We do have a dog but he doesn't go to daycare and has good health insurance (actually better than me). 

Future: 6k in retirement account, no plans on buying a house or having kids (we live in Illinois and buying a house would be the dumbest thing we'd do - yes it will appreciate in some value but the market is dead, property taxes are the worst in the country, and we don't plan on living here for longer than 7 years). 

My wife knows all of this and has been a really strong partner and recognizes that some of these mistakes were driven by our poor decisions in life. We are going to change our habits, heck COVID-19 has really helped us look at what matters and that's a roof over our head, a healthy dog, and not eating mac and cheese every night.

The reason was that my financial aid package was so good that I pay next to nothing for my tuition. This essentially meant that there was not a lot of risk of going to college (taking on student loans). I was excited but everything fell flat quickly. College was definitely not what I expected. Freshman year was a disaster. I had no friends, shit grades, and poor mental health. I experience my all-time low during this time and I legit wanted to give up in life. The next couple of semesters went a lot better though. I made friends and got way better grades. I scheduled all of my classes MWF and had more time to myself. Despite of this, my interest in college was fading. 

I'm about to be junior and I want to take a gap year to find what I want to do with my life. I will be working a part-time job and living with my dad so financial security won't be an issue.

844,t3_geizdq,"Hi folks, my wife and I are hoping to buy a house in a year. We will have about $150k cash saved up and would look to be purchasing somewhere in the ~$500k range. At present I am the sole breadwinner for the household as my wife finishes up her last week of Veterinary school. However, this will all change pretty soon. She accepted a job in another state, and I am going to focus on my Master's degree full-time for 6 months, which I have been pursuing part-time for the last year. Between all of that we will have about a month with no salaried income. 

Previously, I have been earning about $100k/yr. My wife will work ""production"" which is the veterinarian equivalent to commission with a floor of $80k but the chance to earn more. Most vets at her practice earn around $100k after a few months once they start generating production.  

Our ""plan"" is for me to resume working full-time at the start of 2021 with only one class remaining in my Masters. We are both ok with this, as this will greatly accelerate the timeline for me to complete and will allow us to finally reach a ""normal"" home life where neither of us is in school for the first time. And at this point we would like to plan to move into our own home. So if all goes to plan, we as a household would have a month-long income gap and at the time we are looking to buy my wife will have a year of income history and I will hopefully have about six months after a six month break.

We are on the verge of signing a lease for a home rental that would give us many of the features we have been desiring (garage, laundry, privacy, etc.). We are not interested in home ownership at this time as we want the flexibility to move around if desired and see this home rental as an opportunity to try out the 'homeowner lifestyle' for one year to see if it is for us.

Current Apartment: $960/month for 800 sq. ft. ($1.2/sq. ft.)

Home Rental: $1,850/month for 2,200 sq. ft. ($0.84/sq. ft.)

We currently have about $70,000 saved up in cash or cash equivalents (including an emergency fund sitting in an HYSA and a large sum in a Schwab brokerage account that I have not invested yet - I've been hesitant to do anything with this due to the market uncertainty and how this housing decision plays out). With our current apartment costs, we bring in about $2,000 more per month than we spend on all expenses combined (housing, food, entertainment, etc.).

I modeled out the increased costs on a monthly basis over the term of the one-year lease and came up with additional housing and utility costs over our current apartment of $17,000 in Year 1 then about $14,000 per year after that if we decide to renew in the home rental. Those figures have not been adjusted for the time value of money. Assume the added utility my wife and I will gain from the house/new features equals the additional housing costs I mentioned above, which is why we are on the fence about this. My question is whether it makes sense to make this change from a financial perspective. 

We have been living well within our means with this apartment and banking cash at a fast rate has been great, so the idea of taking the plunge with this home rental and eating into that rate of growth hurts.

This is my medium range account - not money that I need next month and not my emergency fund, but also not my retirement plan.  At the time, I started with just a broad market US fund, a bond fund, and an international fund.  However, I noticed that, for example, the bond fund didn't include TIPS so I bought a separate TIPS fund, the international fund didn't include small companies, so I bought an international small business fund.  Then I bought a US small business fund because it was outperforming the broad market and wanted to weigh my portfolio slightly more heavily towards small businesses.  I also bought a US real estate fund and international -ex US real estate fund and an emerging markets fund.  I also bought an aerospace/defense fund and a tech fund because those sectors seemed to be outperforming the broad market and I wanted to weight my portfolio more heavily towards them. 

At one point it was fun to try to tweak my portfolio, but now it's just a pain.  I try to keep a certain allocation in each fund, but it's tough - my portfolio is still of a small enough size where buying a single share of a fund noticeably changes the percentage of my portfolio it takes up, especially if it has a high share price, so it's really difficult to dial it in perfectly- like if I'm aiming for a fund to comprise something like 5% of more portfolio and it costs over $200/share. 

At this point I think it'd be much easier to just consolidate into 3-5 funds, but I'm worried about losing diversity that way.  Are any of the funds I listed redundant and could I get rid of them without opening myself up to more risk? Is it generally a good idea to be more heavily weighted in sectors that are outperforming the general market in recent years, or should I just go with the general market?

I do know that her previous home with my dad was foreclosed on in early 2016, so that may have to do with it, and also the fact that they're still married, and haven't filed taxes in years.  

Right now I honestly have no clue if banks are even giving out new loans, period, let alone to somebody with her credit score.  I think she has anywhere from 0-30% equity, but I'm pretty sure she's at least not negative (even with the recent hit to home prices so far with Covid-19).  

Is a 30-year mortgage possible?  If so, anything I should know for my mom's particular situation?  And is is true that she's just categorically ineligible for some reason?

870,t3_gegzhq,"Hey team, I recently started saving for retirement over the last couple years (I currently have about 15k in my RothIRA and only about 3k in my 401K - started the 401K a little later).  I get my company's max contributions on the 401K and I currently have a rule set up to invest $250 every two weeks into my roth ira (to max out the $6,000/year). 

I'm wondering if I should keep pushing forwards investing - which I believe is the case - or if I should take a break and just put money aside in a savings account (1.55% APY) for later.  The ""break"" I'm referring to would primarily be relieved from my Roth IRA as I would like to continue getting free money from my work. 

Vast majority of my roth IRA is in stocks, and as I'm new in learning all of this investing/retirement stuff, for some reason, stocks is easier to understand than bonds, all the other options out there. I started investing with Fidelity in January and whenever I log on I dread seeing my total +/- on my account as I'm currently like $800 (6%) down (since starting with Fidelity in January) - and I know about the whole corona situation). I understand $800 is not a lot of money - but I'm just starting out and, as a newbie would, I'm thinking I'd be $800 richer if I didn't invest the past few months. 

TLDR Should I temporarily pause my contributions to my roth IRA and still set them aside in my savings account guaranteed the 1.55% (and then move it over once the market/corona calms down - not that I'm trying to time the market) OR should I ignore my losses over the last few months and keep charging ahead?

I was recently given a conditional job offer on the condition that I pass a background check and that they receive an employment reference from my current supervisor.

We are looking at purchasing a home that's about $1.75 million total purchase price (bay area). 

Bank 1 has offered us (through a special relationship with my employer) a rate of 3.875% for 30-year fixed mortgage, but only requires 10% down payment with no PMI requirement.

Bank 2 has offered us a rate of 3.125% for 30-year fixed mortgage, but requires 20% down payment, and the 3.125% low rate is conditioned upon us putting $500k cash in a Bank 2 account (I think this $500k would include the down payment amount and isn't on top of/additional to the down payment, thankfully!). If I didn't put the $500k cash in a Bank 2 account, the rate would be 3.375% instead.

I'm trying to figure out which option makes more sense in the long run overall (setting aside fairly obvious generalizations like ""with option 1, your monthly payments would be higher than in option 2""). We would plan to hold the property for at least 8-10 years, unlikely to hold for 30 years, though.

890,t3_gfwa6h,"**Step 1: Don't do a budget.**
For God's sake, whatever you do, don't do a budget! You sort of know how much you get paid, but if you do it right, you won't know how much you spend. Ignorance is bliss.

**Step 2: Never use cash.**
Cash has a weird way of having you count it before handing it over, which causes a bit of financial pain and that's no good. With a credit card, you ‘just swipe it and forget it,’ no pain there my friend.

**Step 3: Impulse Buy.**
You work hard. You totally deserve that $2,000 treadmill in 5 easy payments. Just buy it, don't even think about it. The rule of thumb is, when it pops in your head, stop what you're doing, jump online, give Amazon your 16 digits, and be sure NOT to save the receipt, you don't need any reminders about the cost, now do you?

**Step 4: Never address spending with your significant other.**
If at all possible, avoid the conversation completely. If you feel a conversation about money emerging, run out of the room as quickly as possible, make up any excuse. I have to walk the dog; my mistress is waiting; I’m part of a crack commando squad and the choppa is waiting; just get the hell out of there!

**Step 5: If you can't avoid the conversation, just blame the other for spending too much.**
The blame game is where it's at baby. I highly recommend accusing your significant other that they spend too much or they make too little, or both; and simultaneously convince them that you deserve that 25 foot bass boat because she and the kids are stressing you out about money. And don’t forget to take out a loan for it.

**Step 6: Always use credit cards.**
Use high interest cards and always pay the minimum payments, nothing more. Remember, the higher the APR and crappier the terms, the better.

**Step 7: Always buy ‘just-in-case’ items.**
Why buy just one TV when you can get two for twice the price. That’s what I do, because you might need it for the guest room that your estranged family should never use. Also, if you happen to be out-and-about, go to your favorite store, walk aimlessly through the aisles and just pick things up, it doesn't matter what, because you'll eventually need it, right? And don't forget to use a credit card; you don't need to be counting any cash.

**Step 8: If your friends make more than you, keep up with their spending.**
Your friends obviously make more money than you if they spend more. And it's totally a competition. If you spend more than them, you win!

**Step 9: Buy things to impress others.**
Do you want to be the envy of the neighborhood? Do you want your friends to be jealous? Do you want to show-up your family? Well I have the answer for you; buy numerous and expensive things to show how successful you are. Make sure you flaunt it as well, how else are they going to know. It doesn't matter if you can afford it. With a credit card, you can afford anything! And who would know more about this than the good people in the debt finance industry; if they didn't think you could afford it, why would they lend you the money?

**Step 10: No matter what you do, don't change.**
Don't change any of your spending habits. Change eventually leads to savings, and savings leads to the accumulation of wealth. Wealth, yuck.",10 easy steps to being broke.,r/personalfinance,0.5,0,1588983981.0,2,0

The best part of it was that the biggest nomination was from our CEO's EA, who had historically had a terrible relationship with IT, and now here she was, nominating all of us for an award.

I started writing this post and realized it was going to be a long one, so TL;DR is above. The story of getting from zeroes to heroes follows ...

\-----

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

899,t3_gfqrhd,"Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins. Ie. Working on a ticket then logging how much time you spent actively working on it. And being expected to account for your full 8 hour day.


More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized. I'm mainly trying to decide if it's something I just accept and fudge the numbers like im told is common practice (track 30 min blocks of time and just split up the 8 hours however you feel on whichever tickets you worked on), or if maybe it's time to update my resume as it's as uncommon as I think, a sign of distrust and potentially worse things to come.",Is Sysadmin time tracking a thing?,r/sysadmin,0.79,19,1588962742.0,57,1

909,t3_gfsp9z,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

Three typical tiers on the system; sql data, application and web tiers.  All running on one server but due to growth and need for more secutity, I have developed a potential topology along with the vendor, to segregate all three tiers in their own subnet.  The web and application tiers will sit in a dmz which needs to be internet exposed.  Sql can live in a more protected subnet.

My issue is how to proceed with active directory and domain membership.  I am identifying 2 problems thus far:

1.  The web and application systems in the dmz need to write to a windows file share on the sql servers.  
2. All systems in all three tiers need to be members of the same domain to permit utilization of domain resources.

It was one thing where everything was combined in the same server and on one subnet, with a local domain controller.  Now with different subnets of varying security, I have web and application servers in a dmz but the domain controller in the trusted, probably next to the sql server in its own subnet.

Ive read some case studies and they range from not adding the dmz servers to AD and using local account (yechhhh!).  Or a completely separate domain for AD for servers in the DMZ and another one for the sql system in the trusted LAN.  Ive stumbled upon AD federation and its a bit new to me, still reading about it and dont know if its the proper tool for me.

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS currently.  This is a test virtual server.

I am trying to use realmd to connect to Active Directory and I am successfully joining but running into issues which seem to be related to group enumeration ( and as a result, authentication issues for users trying to connect via SSH, I will explain)..

Here is the method I used to join the domain (subbing out the actual domain name for 'domain'):

    yum install -y realmd 
    yum upgrade -y
    realm discover domain.local
    yum install -y &lt;packagename&gt;....   # after running realm discover it will display necessary package dependencies, I've installed them all.
    sudo apt install packagekit
    
    realm join --user=domain_admin --computer-ou='&lt;Valid OU for computer object&gt;' --os-name='Ubuntu' DOMAIN.LOCAL
    
    reboot
    
    vi /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
      -  I set 'use_fully_qualified_names = false'
      -  I set 'fallback_homedir = /home/DOMAIN/%u'
    systemctl restart sssd

The domain has an AD security group, ""srv-servername-ssh"" and if you are a part of that AD security group, you are permitted to log in via SSH.   I use sshd\_config on my servers to specify (via AllowGroups) certain AD groups which are permitted to SSH to the box.   This works, as long as the system realizes the user trying to log in is part of a valid group.

My issue is: in most cases, if I try to perform this command..

    id user1

..it recognizes the AD user, but returns only a few groups (usually only returns 'domain users' group, very rarely returns the membership list).

If I try typing the following, I can see the full group membership:

    getent group srv-servername-ssh

I am lost on why this is happening, but it is preventing reliable SSH login for the domain users who are supposed to be able to , since the server usually doesn't recognize the user as being part of a valid (allowed) group for SSH access.  Any idea?

I am(and some others) are working on a riskanalysis report to find bad routines, processes and practices in a company and I was wondering if you guys could give me some of your thoughts about good questions to give the sysadmins and developers. I have used  ISO/IEC 27002 to try find some best practices that I should check them on already.

An example of a process  missing is having no formal process in handling a security breach by an employee(spear phished). 

Another example is a bad routine of using the workmail for other things than work.

Now the reason I ask here is because I had an interview with a sysadmin and tried to find some bad practices, routines or processes but it seemed they had very good control. And even thou that is good, I want to find SOMETHING to leave in the riskanalysis report that could make the report intresting.

I hope I can get some inspiration in this post to find something that might be of good use to the company.","General questioning around best practices, routines and processes",r/sysadmin,0.5,0,1588990299.0,0,1
922,t3_gfy778,"TL;DR

What is planning? Firewall licenses expired, new firewall quickly installed, but not fully configured. Need both running at the same time, on same subnet. Currently cannot connect to any devices pointing to the new gateway when logged into VPN, but can still access devices with the old gateway still statically assigned.

Hey all - been pulling my hair out all day, hoping to get some advice to what I'm overlooking here.

Scenario: SonicWall FireWall is getting replaced by Cisco Meraki FireWall. We were not ready to do the switchover, but licensing expired. We have set up DHCP to point to our Meraki as the Gateway to ensure we're using the licensed content filtering, as our SonicWall CFS expired.

Everything inside our network seems to be fine - users still have internet access, and the content filtering is working.

The problem comes that we're still using our NetExtender VPN licenses, as we haven't done the configuration to get the Cisco Meraki VPN set up with our Active Directory.


The issue we're having is that after the gateway changed in our DHCP and our workstations got the updated gateway, some of our remote users who were using the NetExtender VPN + RDP to get to their desktop are now unable to get to their workstation when the gateway is set to our Cisco Meraki gateway.


Does anyone know what settings I need to adjust to make sure that our NetExtender SSL VPN is able to connect to these machines?

    Gateway 1: 192.168.1.1 -&gt; Points to Fiber Connection
    Gateway 2: 192.168.1.2 -&gt; Points to COAX Connection

The above is an example of the two gateways - not my actual IP addressing. They're on the same subnet, I need to maintain both of them temporarily, as I have a Site-to-Site VPN to an offsite Data Center that I can't break until we pull backups from the DataCenter (previous MSP is still hosting some servers for us - we're working on getting away from them)


Any help would be appreciated - I'm not well versed in networking, and basically learn as I go, but this has me stumped. 

Right now we're having these users connect to our terminal server that we maintain for emergency access, but we have limited seats at the moment due to budget reasons.

My company has a small client that is running 2008r2, and we were recently approved to upgrade both their physical server as well as their OS.

Like many, I started out as a computer repair technician.  Since then, I’ve been a senior sysadmin, architect, and I’m in management now.  I’m still all of those things.

My first paid gig was in the late 90s when everyone was buying their computers with home service warranties.  I’d drive over a 150 mile radius diagnosing and servicing computers. I’d drive out, diagnose the issue, and usually come back a few days later once the identified part came in.  I got paid by the visit.  A return visit meant more money for me, but all diagnosis were validated over the phone with dispatch, and dispatch would also talk to the customer and ask them some questions too to make sure everything is done right.  It was fun and easy, and educational.  But I was on my own out there.  The customer’s computer was broken. I didn’t have internet access - smartphones didn’t exist.   Laptops were super expensive, and dialing over a cellular modem was stupid slow and also ridiculously expensive.  Nobody did that.  


So, one of my most critical tools (beside my memory and sheer tenacity) involved a blue tri-fold CD case that I bought at Walmart.  Oddly enough, 20 years later, I can still remember picking among the available cases for something that had enough slots but wasn’t too big to fit in my rolling tool/laptop bag and wasn’t too expensive.  CDs were a big deal then.  Cassettes were still on sale, but barely.  They were starting to phase them out entirely.  The iPod was not yet a thing.  CDs were a very big deal.  So, cases were popular and not many were made in China yet, so they were not cheap. 


Anyway, the computer technician’s CD collection was something you had to build yourself.  There wasn’t a standard.  You had to figure out what you needed by yourself.


I collected CDs like found treasures.  I had everything.  DOS, NT, Windows 95/98/ME/2k/XP/Vista and Win7. Windows 8 was never in my case. I never used the DOS CD, it was just something someone had and I got a copy of it because “who knows” if I might need it.  Anyway, for those wondering - DOS only came on floppies - someone converted the install to work off CD.  I’m not sure how, I never looked.  But you bet your ass that went into my case.


I had Windows XP OEM vs Retail.  I had Home vs Pro.  I had the Dell OEM version.   VLM / Enterprise versions.  Server versions. The various XP and Windows versions were CRITICALLY important to have because those of us who figured out how to do a “repair install” properly way back in the day pretty much figured it out on our own. The trick was to have the right VERSION of the CD or your product key wouldn’t work with it.   With the right technique I could even move your windows install to new hardware without a bluesreen.  Believe it or not someone being able to move your windows install to new hardware was kinda unusual at the time.  The worst thing you can do is repair Windows with the wrong CD and then not be able to activate it with their product key, LOL.  Definitely hard to explain to a customer how suddenly their windows isn’t “genuine” anymore.


Previous versions of Windows had much less strict key code checking.  In fact, I used to have a universal code memorized for 95/98.  I have no idea now what it was now.  But this was something that served
me well on many occasions.  I can’t count how many times I’d ask a customer for their original CD cases or manuals (that’s where the code was stuck depending on the product) and they didn’t have it anymore.  Oops.  Time to stick in the bootleg code from the list that I also kept in my CD case, lol.  

People didn’t have high speed internet, even in the mid- (even late-) 2000s you couldn’t count on customers having it.  Some folks just didn’t have it yet.  So, you needed to be self sufficient.

Most of my CDs were copies.  I made a copy of anything I could.  Of course I had Office - all versions.  Thinks like SpinRite, gParted, Paragon Partition Manager, Acronis w/Universal Restore, Ghost...  AV scanners, hijackthis, autoruns.   Custom BartPE.  Other random “all in one” boot CDs.

I also had to have some blank CDs or DVDs for backups or in case I needed to create a boot CD for something.  There’s been at least a few times where I had to leave a place and come back later with a blank CD because I didn’t have a spare on me.  I also kept a blank floppy and a DOS boot floppy (good for BIOS updates) within my CD case.

Anyway, with flash drives being ubiquitous and internet being ubiquitous (my cell can tether at high speed, etc) I started noticing I’m using flash drives more and CDs less. Laptops are not coming with CD drives.  Servers are not coming with CD drives.  Software doesn’t come in a box.

I haven’t used a CD *at all* in at least 5 years.  

I opened my CD case today.  Everything I have touched in many years has been Windows 10.  I won’t need a CD for that.  I don’t have a CD for that.  I thumbed through it all... there’s nothing in it there that I need anymore.  I pulled them all out one by one, considering each one.  For a few of them I would reflexively think for a moment “oh yeah I need that one, it’s a keeper”.  Moments later I would remind myself that “no, I will never need it again.”  


I did save a couple truly unique ones to make an .iso image “just in case I decide to play around with them someday” and then I threw all of the CDs away.  

Though, I’m not sure I’m ready to throw my case away.  It’s weird to realize that I have some odd attachment to this ragged blue peice of junk.  It’s empty.  It has no CDs. I don’t need it anymore.  But it’s still in my drawer.

I do have a collection of software and software tools, but it’s on my hard drive (and also backed up).  These days I just I copy things onto a flash if I need them, or just use them over the network.  I definitely don’t have the same emotional attachment to my current collection of stuff that I seem to have had with my CDs. I know if I lose something these days I can just google it and download it again wherever I am.

(I don't know what this prd.mydomain.local record is for)

Second - in our DNS mgmt on our Windows DCs, there are a few things I don't understand. I do see that 'prd' sub folder under our mydomain.local zone, and it has nameserver records for all three of our DCs. Also, we have the 'Forward Lookup zones' with a '\_msdcs.mydomain.local' in it's own zone, which has nameserver records for all three DCs and CNAMEs for all three DCs. It also has the dc, domain, etc sub folders in it. Then we have our mydomain.local zone with a sub folder for '\_msdcs' which just has nameserver records for all three of our DCs.

Sorry if this is a lot of info all in one here, but I am at a loss at how we can fix this. I also found other posts about broken delegation, but a lot of solutions have been finding some duplicate or erroneous record that they deleted and it fixed the issue. I am not seeing such records in our environment though.

I appreciate any advice and feedback as always!

\*\*EDIT: We removed the prd folder since we determined it wasn't needed, and now the delegation error for that went away.

Steps completed:

* Created new AD User account (not in exchange)
* Disabled existing user A's mailbox
* Connected Disabled Mailbox User A's to New AD-User B.
* Deleted User A from Azure AD.
* Ran Full Azure AD Syncronization to populate User A in Azure AD.

Target is a new 2019 DPM installation running on Server 2019 with new storage retaining the current tape backups - the disk backups are not such a concern.  

I cannot seem to find any guidance on technet on how I can move DPM 2012R2 ro 2019 without doing a whole bunch of in place upgrades (which also doesn't seem to help with the move to new hardware), whilst preserving the tape backups AND also at the same time moving the SQL database as this too is on a retired OS.

We are a hybrid environment: ERP/AD/Print/DHCP/AV is on-prem, Sharepoint/m365/webapps are in the cloud. Our process is about 85% cloud, 15% on-prem. If people are offsite they rarely interact with the ERP system via VPN, and AD/Print/DHCP/AV is moot. 

We have gige fiber WAN and Cloud PBX (metaswitch commportal). We have 60 users, 30 are in the main office, 30 are spread around 12-20 remote SF Bay Area jobsites. Internet traffic is 400-800GB/week (has been less since COVID). We have roughly $100M in volume, $3-6M in revenue. My IT budget is roughly $100-150k/year including hardware and software licensing.

We have annual power outage events that last for multiple days. The previous few years we've either been lucky, or have sent users home to work via the cloud. When power goes out our upstream WAN might be on battery, but it doesn't last very long. Cellular becomes so congested that even a simple MMS takes 10 - 30 mins and can't support one person, let alone many.

I am wanting to gain a better understanding of how ATA plays a role in some of its functions.  Presently on the network we've had ATA alerting the SysAdmins that generic LDAP has been used and to switch to secure LDAP.  What I'm starting to notice is that the devices are falling off of the list after people are changing to port 636 and selecting SSL despite actually obtaining a certificate to go along with it.  

Am I incorrect in thinking that this is literally sending clear-text data over a port that is used for secure encrypted data?  Next time I'm in the office I will have the opportunity to run Wireshark and see if this is indeed the case but I wanted to have an open discussion about this.  I'm assuming that ATA is just checking what port is in use and reporting accordingly and doesn't do any sort of deep dive into the security piece of whether the data is actually secure/encrypted or not. ",Microsoft ATA and discovering unsecure LDAP connections,r/sysadmin,0.5,0,1588910645.0,2,1
1007,t3_gfdtjy,"So I'm looking for opinions from folks who are fairly familiar with their choices.

In the interest of job security, we're gonna say this is a ""hypothetical situation"". :D

So let's say that I have an elderly AD and LDAP setup.  Neither speak to each other, so each directory is separate.  Users currently exist in both directories with the same usernames, but no passwords are sync'd.  And of course all the management of these systems is done via arcane tools and scripts that were copied off of scrolls that traversed the Atlantic on the May Flower.

So now I'm (again, hypothetically) looking for a modern directory system.  User accounts for Windows and Linux workstations, so therefore I need AD and LDAP equivalent functionality.  Integrating with Office 365 may be nice, but not 100% necessary.  There are other SaaS services that would use AD or LDAP integration for authentication.  And the current AD domain is irrelevant, so an entirely new domain can be created.

So for options, there is the obvious of on-prem AD.  I've setup AD before to auth Win and Linux users.  I could do old school LDAP on-prem, and a Samba 4 setup for the Windows users.  There are even ""wrapper"" options like Univention that put a GUI on basic LDAP and Samba.  Heck Webmin could probably do the same.

There are cloud offerings like Azure AD (which I think still requires on-prem DC's).  JumpCloud is another one I have started to look at, and am curious about that one.  Okta I think is more for SSO than a directory server.

1009,t3_gfdc0z,"Hi all. I hope this is the appropriate place for this question. I work for a small (&lt;10 person) software company and we run an OpenVPN server through Synology DSM's VPN Server module. It's great, because it requires almost zero configuration, authenticates with a username and password by default (which is our preferred authentication protocol over individual client certificates), and supports up to 30 simultaneous connections (plenty for us). 

However, for our macOS users, we are experiencing some exceptionally weird behavior that has been going on and we've been sucking it up for the past few weeks (a headache for our team members who need to access our local Bitbucket server). I have been unable to find any reports of similar behavior online, nor has OpenVPN's authentication troubleshooting proved useful. We have tried OpenVPN Connect Client and Tunnelblick, and use the default .ovpn configuration that is provided by the Synology interface.

Users will attempt to connect to the VPN, receive the error ""Missing external certificate"" which you can continue past anyway, and then often times will have to retry the login 10-15 times getting ""User authentication failed"" errors in the client, until eventually a successful connection is established. We've whitelisted the affected user's IP addresses from the Synology ""Auto Block"" feature which evidently prevents login from an IP after a certain number of failed logins, which did not improve the situation. Interestingly, the VPN Server module's log viewer only shows connect/disconnect events, and not any failed authentication messages. We get similar behavior using Tunnelblick - here's some relevant log information:

Yet I've been searching for a good job for about five years now and even with seven years of experience I can't seem to get a final offer with a good salary. I make it to third round interviews only to be hit with the cultural fit excuse. I think I finally know why based on feedback I've gotten.

For whatever reason, employers don't see what I think of myself. I'm not the most advanced computer guy, and I don't like programming/taking tests. I've been told that I'm eccentric, an acquired taste and intimidating, maybe a bit egotistical and too laid back. These are traits that you would find in Hollywood, Wall Street, Sales, or Law Firms. Not an IT storage closet.  Yet everyone always said I was good at computers and that I should do what I liked for a living so I perused the IT career thinking this would be the perfect place. And I've spent a good portion of my career living up to this idea that eventually the right job will come along. It hasn't. While I've spent more time trying to find a new role than investing in my studies it hasn't prevented me from getting to final interviews for jobs I'm qualified for. Yet something about me is off-putting to IT teams. I don't really know what it is, but I'm beginning to understand the writing on the wall.

It hasn't been an easy road either. Every job I've ever got wasn't because I was super qualified and I was someone they wanted to work with, it was because they wanted to give me a shot. They also weren't some glamorous tech jobs either like I'd dreamt about. Just start-ups, boring offices, or non-profits with no money. Every boss I've ever had said that to me upon my start date and that is just defeating. I struggled with finding passion for the studying, for dealing with karen's, and I have PTSD from working in a small team filled with gamers, or people who seemed to hate life/are angry. I'm not saying this is the majority of the industry. I haven't had much exposure to the tech industry in general, but that's the type I've run into.

Right now, I'm in retail and actually like it a lot better than any tech job I've had. Despite the pay and the current COVID-19 danger. I know I would hate working from home right now!

I have recently volunteered to be a mentor for up and coming IT peeps looking to break into the field. I finally feel secure enough and confident in my experience to be able to pass on some wisdom to people that might be earlier in their career path. I'm super grateful for this opportunity because I'll be able to offer insights that I wasn't afforded when I was starting out, and I think a lot of us might share that sentiment. 

I know when I began my career I was the stereotypical ""solo admin"". Responsible for everything, tier 1-3. Printer broke? That's me. Domain trust broke? Also me. It was stressful, and I really had no outlet for support or guidance on best practices or how to handle complex issues technical or otherwise. My guidance came from Google, self learning, and certification opportunities. I didn't have anyone in person that was senior I could get solid guidance from. 

The local program I'm working with is grant funded focuses on minority communities and non-traditional students looking to break into the IT field. (think people of color, career changes, community college graduates etc.) I'll have an opportunity over the next 6-12 months to help them focus their career search, develop skills, and guide them through their early career steps. 

I'm super excited about being able to be a resource for people that might need it most, early in their career with tech. I want to encourage anyone with some experience under their belt to search out your local opportunities and share your knowledge. I know I could have benefitted greatly from having an early career mentor and I know there are more mentees out there looking for guidance than there are mentors willing to step up.

1028,t3_gfb188,"My current position is managing two small/mid-sized environments. I'm salaried, one district pays for 100% of my salary and benefits, and the other pays them 30% of that, so the cost comes out to 70% at my actual employer and 30% at my ""contracted"" position.

This works out to being onsite at one district most of the time, and the other I go to three days every two weeks. 

After getting to know the environments, the time and pay should be flipped. The 30% is in necrosis. They haven't made updates to their environment in about 10 years. A majority of their computers are running win7, there's one server (out of support ofc) that runs EVERYTHING for their environment. (DC, Exchange, RDS, DNS, DHCP, File, Print, IIS, applications, etc.) And I'll mention the users briefly... zero technical training. Had a spam campaign come through the other week and over half the users clicked the links in both the email and the secondary website. By some miracle their AV caught it and stopped anything from happening. My contacts over there just shrugged it off as no big deal. They could have lost their entire environment, and it's no big deal to them, business as usual.

The 30% is bleeding me dry. They need more attention than the 70% and they'll need more work down the road. I bring up the fact that they are constantly bombarding me to the 70% and their stance is ""You figure it out."" They don't want to deal with the relationship between the districts, and that this deal was ultimately designed to take advantage of me. Feels like they both want 100% of my time but neither one wants to pay for it.

And of course their stance is ""IT is not that important"", so trying to get these complaints through to management is like throwing shit at a brick wall. 

I want to leave, but I've been here for less than a year. And during this pandemic, I've seen way too many people land jobs then get the offers revoked. This situation would be less stressful, but I have a wife and two kids that I support.

No matter the amount of research I have done on this subject, I am always left with more questions than answers. Thanks Microsoft!

We are looking to have 8 operating systems in use in our environment. We have two hosts. Each host has 2 sockets, and each socket has 10 cores. This means between the two hosts, we would be licensing 20 cores. This is where the information for me has been becoming tricky:

Since this is a virtual environment where the VMs could migrate to the other host, should I be looking to purchase enough licenses for 16 OSEs? And does each ""full license"" contain 2 OSEs? If yes, then my math seems to be as follows:

Cores (20) \* 8 (since each license covers 2 OSEs) = 160 cores to be licensed

Cores / 2 = 80 2-license packs

80 \* \~$121 = $9680 to have this environment fully licensed.

Recently we did a **migration from G Suite to O365**. We used the MS' EXO migration wizardry tool, which migrated emails, contacts and calendar.

We also removed her Google account from her Android phone and installed Outlook app (with MS account) and enabled contacts sync. No issues there.

**The issue is with mobile phone numbers.** 

Quite a few contacts on O365, do not appear to have the phone numbers. **I realize this is because the user was using custom labels on her contacts (on gmail) and these labels do not exist on Outlook. So, i'm assuming those phone numbers got ignored in the migration process.**

The first part are drops that repeat over and over in the logs. Good to know that the firewall is working but why would it be blocking connections that were originating from my LAN if these were replies to those initial outgoing traffic? Aren't these blocks originating externally and NOT replies to traffic from my network?

The last entry is what I saw after I changed the cable modem DHCP Pool to [10.1.10.2](https://10.1.10.2) \- [10.1.10.2](https://10.1.10.2) forcing the tomato router wan port to be assigned the [10.1.10.2](https://10.1.10.2) address. So whatever that is lost the IP address of [10.1.10.3](https://10.1.10.3) and then sent a broadcast \[ ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff \] to the internal network between my cable modem and router!!! WTF!!?!?!??

Am I misinterpreting this???

The internal and external MAC address of my cable modem interfaces are xx:xx:xx:xx:a6:0a and xx:xx:xx:xx:a6:0e. So the MAC address that appears ass the MACSRC in the logs \[xx:xx:xx:xx:a6:0d\] has to be associated with that cable modem or my ISP.

But the SRC IP ADDR aren't. I looked up the three listed via ARIN WhoIs and ehy belong to Google, Inc., [Fastly.com](https://Fastly.com) and Hewlett Packard.

* No AutoArchive settings enabled that I can see, in either Outlook or Exchange Admin Center
* No mail flow rules
* Didn't seem to be an actual ""Archive,"" local or otherwise, but instead just the normal folder named Archive
* User has never even seen the manual Archive option before in Outlook &amp; has certainly never used it
* No suspicious logins on his account (and if someone hacked his account you'd think they'd do something more interesting than relocating emails)
* O365 audit logs shows the user was 'responsible' for the email moves and didn't have OWA open so it has to have happened within his Outlook

The copy has a combination of many fairly small files, and some very big ones. Most are already compressed. The destination is behind a gateway server on which SSH keys are banned. The origin can only be accessed over SSH via VPN. Copying can only take place overnight. The origin does not have enough spare room to create many significant intermediate files. Both ends are having pretty frequent connection issues. It's ZFS to ZFS but we're only taking a subset of the data so we can't just copy a snapshot.

rsync over a jump server is fine; I can use keys to get onto the destination and was thinking of using sshpass to get through the gateway (not ideal, but none of these requirements are, so...). The password needs to be in a file somewhere (cron has to source the environment, or sshpass can read from the file), unless I want to babysit it every evening and morning. I'm going to use a python script to orchestrate the rsync job, restart after connection issues, and send a SIGTERM when our time is up. I'm pretty sure CPU isn't a limiting factor but I'm going to disable compression and use a weak SSH cipher just in case - as I say, most of the files are compressed already. tar over netcat isn't useful because it won't easily resume after an exit.

We are investigating what options we have of tools to choose from for Remote Control\*, Patch Management\*\*, Operating System Deployment (Windows/Mac)\*\*\*, Software Deployment\*\*\*\* and Mobile Device Management\*\*\*\*\* etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\* We are currently using TeamViewer for Remote Control which we are happy with because you can support the computer even though it is not connected to our domain.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* We do not currently have an visual overview of our clients on the network (only AD), which causes great frustration as you have no idea which client is running which Windows / Mac versions as we have clients in different country's and on board ships.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* We buy computers with Windows 10 OEM versions, which means that we do not use any licenses other than the OEM version the PC is born with. All setups are set up manually: Create local admin user, change the name of the PC, install various software such as Office 365, Sophos Endpoint and Sophos VPN, TeamViewer and more and eventually enroll the computer to the domain.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\* Today we have to install all software manually (as mentioned above). This means we first have to log on to the client computer, find the installation file and then wait for the installation to be completed.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\* Today we do not have any control over our mobile devices, which means that we do not have the ability to manage company data.

&amp;#x200B;

We currently have Office 365, but Exchange-server is still On-Prem - we are moving our Exchange On-Prem to Exchange Online.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope there is one (or more) firendly soul(s) who will come up with their suggestions as to which tool (software) we should choose and of course a reason why.

I have seen some very impressive scripts around here, with powershell interfaces, database backends, communicating with RESTful APIs, etc.

I recently posted asking for advice on an IPAM application I wrote and am refining, with a majority of replies essentially saying stop and don't. I'm not discounting their opinions, I'm aware it's not optimal for many reasons, and it's not what this post is for. 

But it did get me thinking about how far is too far. A previous admin in the main IT dept (maybe 25 to 30 years ago?) had written a custom `passwd` program in C that got put on all the Linux servers to change their LDAP credentials, and when I arrived and saw that was still being used it was one of the first things I fixed (moved to IdM). They had to know it was a bad idea, but management/office politics/something must have forced their hand. I think we can all agree that went too far. But where would you stop and draw the line on IT programming? Is the puppet code that handles our configuration management too much if I wrote a few custom modules to help abstract everything? Is your custom script that automates a crucial task but needs to be maintained too much?

**Title:** Multiple credential prompts in the Outlook client 

**User impact:** Users may receive repeated credential prompts within the Outlook client. 

**More info:** While we're focused on remediation, users that have access to other protocols such as Outlook on the web or mobile devices can access their email without issue. Additionally, customers who are able to use Modern Authentication may enable it to mitigate impact for affected users. Details on how to enable Modern Authentication can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/enable-or-disable-modern-authentication-in-exchange-online 

**Current status:** We've determined that a recent Exchange Online update contains a code issue which is resulting in repeated credential prompts. We've halted deployment of the build to prevent further spread of impact and we're discussing mitigation steps for this event. We've confirmed that this issue appears to only affect basic authentication configuration users. 

**Scope of impact:** This issue may affect any user that has service-based search or Focused Inbox.

Hoping someone's seen this before or can explain why it might be happening.

We have a number of enterprise apps deployed utilizing Azure AD for identity management.

We have conditional access in place.. normal behavior is that MFA is only required when logging in from a location beyond our country's borders.

We have enabled SSPR (self service password reset) which works fine since it was implemented mid 2019.

In early Feb this year, we enabled the MFA + SSPR converged registration portal. All was well.

In early March, an odd issue started happening. For only 2 of our enterprise apps, every time a user logs in, they get the message saying they are required to complete their security registration, and it directs them to the MFA + SSPR portal to complete it. Virtually all users are already registered, and when they get there it just says setup complete, then they're able to login to the app.

It doesn't matter whether they've already completed their security info or not. They get directed there every time they log in. I've confirmed this with several users who definitely had their security info registered.

This is wierd and it should just be logging straight into the app. They are all in-country when this happens and i've confirmed via AAD logs they are not being flagged by conditional access.

There's no other logs i can find in AAD that explains this behaviour, and its only affected 2 particular applications.

Don’t get me wrong... it had its share of BS, just like any job will have. But the small, 3 person, IT team meshed well together and wasn’t where any work dramas would happen. Which I appreciated greatly. 

I was able to learn a lot there, on a lot of different technologies, with a lot of different vendors. I had to wear the “jack-of-all-trades” hat, which came with its’ own pros &amp;amp; cons. Networking, VoIP, Monitoring/SIEM, Windows, VMware Virtualization, Backups, Cloud platforms... I got to touch and manage it all. It really expand my depth and scope of knowledge in a way that would be hard to replicate.

In the end my new job is giving me a 4 day work week (something I’ve always desired), a sizable jump in pay (just in time for a coming baby), and more opportunities for greater future growth and movement.

The two key takeaways that I would like to share are: 

(1) Get some certifications. I know a lot of people have heavy feelings on both sides of the “are certs worth it” debate. For years I was always ‘meh’ about earning certs. There is a place for knowledge and experience over a  cert. But in the last couple years I’ve started actively pursuing certs and you’d be surprised at the number of potential doors it has opened. I’ve gotten quite a few offers from places, just for having that “silly” piece of paper. I’m talking about learning and knowing a subject matter enough to pass a certification on it. With all the online learning resources out there, it should not be too hard to find some study materials or on-demand labs to help you. 

I feel like you should engage that big heap of gray matter you have and earn a certification. That cert is a tangible asset from a 3rd party which verifies that you know the particular subject matter of what the cert is for. Hell, aim low, if you want! Find an “easy” (that term is relative to your current knowledge level and skill sets) and minimal effort certification you can work on in your down, or off, time. That spark of satisfaction you get after you earn one certification will likely carry you to earning your next one.

(2) Be yourself and make friends. It really is your circle of connections and people you interact with that can pull you forward. I feel like this new job sprouted from a conversation I had a couple years back with the husband of a friend of my wife’s. We got along well (both worked in IT, different roles and industries). When they had a position open, he reached out about the opening. It was a great opportunity. I applied and ultimately got the job.

I recently joined a company where the admin setup DFS and pooched it by ""helping DFS"" by manually copying over files to speed up the process. Now on the Secondary site there is a huge backlog, and dfs is barely working now. I am afraid to destroy DFS and re-set it up without doing a full audit because DFS was setup with Namespace with both sites active/active so there are files in both sites and out of sync.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I wanted to restart from scratch so I did an audit between both systems using robocopy /mir /secfix /timfix /copyall /L  from Site 1 --&gt; Site 2 and from Site 2 --&gt; Site 1.

My findings were quite odd and interesting at the same time, there are tonnes of files that robocopy indicates as ""modified"" but they aren't really modified. I looked at their attributes, timestamp, security settings, file size, and its all identical. To the point that I even ran MD5SUM between files on both sites and the MD5SUM hash was also identical but yet DFS and Robcopy seem to think there is a change.

A little background:  Joined the IT world about a year ago and I'm working as a Jr. Sys Admin in a manufacturing setting (4 main plants).  Solid proficiency in the tech, A+ certified, and always looking to learn new skills, tech, etc. 

Now, I had an issue today where a ticket came in about a computer that wasn't working properly, but it didn't come from that computers owner, it came from another user in the factory (receptionist).  Issue was stated in ticket as ""they can't access the pc, keeps kicking them off, can't access email... blah blah.""  Well as this particular PC has only one user and the plant manager forbade anyone from using it besides the person who's job it is to sit at that desk, I responded with ""who is ""they""?  As I understood, this computer is only supposed to have one user and nobody else is supposed to be touching that pc"".  

This was not read in the manner it was written and managed to piss off the receptionist.  She complains to her boss (the plant manager) and my boss gets an chewing out from the plant manager that he wants nothing to do with me and he doesn't want me anywhere near his plant.  Then a bunch more comes out from other workers there, plant floor and supervisors alike, that I'm rude to them and not professional.  All tickets from this plant are to now go through the Sys admin instead of me trying to troubleshoot.  

Now I'll admit, I've had some Customer service skill issues recently (mostly from emails taken out of tone, or a panicked phone call trying to prevent a user from taking down the whole phone network, but I am working on it.  This incident has made me ill.  A full plant not allowing me at their site because the tiny amount of interaction I have with their user base has ruffled some feathers.  I consider myself efficient, the work is normally done early when I make these trips.  I've never heard a single complaint until today when it all avalanched on my bosses desk.  

What do I do?  My boss says we have to fix this with the plant manager but he (the plant manager) apparently complained about me to the president of the company and I am freaking out along side of being livid with the plant who decided they wanted to throw me under the bus even though their facility has never run smoother.  I'm half tempted to play the smiling robot from here on out with these people so I don't run into any more issues.  

Any advice on any of this?  My boss keeps telling me ""Perception is Reality.""  How do I keep the reality positive without sacrificing who I am as an IT professional?

As a temporary fix to prevent our users from threatening the security of the whole company, I put a wildcard external SharePoint and Sway site block into place in Mimecast.

* Collection of member dues is tied to member's continued access to the club and its assets. If payment is overdue, access is automatically suspended.
* Members can access a self-help portal to view their contact info, update payment info, etc
* Members are granted access to assets either by administrative users or peers qualified to grant access. Assets include tools (power controlled by microcontroller), websites and computers

We are a ""pull yourselves by the bootstraps"" sort of club, and so far here is what's in place:

* Using Stripe for payment processing via Stripe's dashboard. Member payment info is initiated via a  Stripe Checkout page and then updates are managed by the Treasurer, by hand.
* FreeIPA on AWS for ""access control."" On the software side it means access to the Mediawiki (also on AWS) via PluggableAuth. We don't have much documentation on the FreeIPA set up and it could probably use a fresh start.
* Physical access control at the club's entrance using a RaspberryPi hooked up to an electric door strike and RFID fob reader. The RPI runs an instance of FreeIPA that is synchronized with the AWS copy. When a fob is scanned, FreeIPA is searched for an active user with same door code and access is granted/denied.
* Members are added/removed to AWS FreeIPA and mailing list via a shell script
* Access to everything else in the club is on the honor system. There are a few Windows machines that we would love to switch to individual log-ins, instead of a shared one
* Most of the infrastructure lives in AWS and we have plenty of AWS credits annually that we would like to use more.
* We have a few Windows server licenses that have not yet been used
* There is a physical server rack in the space, but it's mostly doing nothing other than provide access to the WAN. Could be invested into.

In my limited understanding, it seems that we should set up either Windows AD (locally) or LDAP properly (locally or in AWS) and use that as the database for member info, somehow tying in the local Windows workstations. From there on we can probably write scripts or code to tie the system to Stripe and access control microcontrollers.

1145,t3_gel70c,"I've been looking for a way to consistently backup my router, switches, and firewalls. [Solarwinds Cattools](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-cattools) works great for the routers, and firewalls; however, some of the switches just don't work with Cattools. So after hunting the Internet for a bit, I found a solution using a Visual Basic script.

What I did was create a 'switches.txt' file with the IP addresses of the switch(es) I was backing up. Keep in mind, though, that all of the IP(s) in this switches.txt file have to have the same username and password; if they don't, you can create another folders with other switches.txt file and another script, and execute it from that folder.

I tried using '[putty](https://putty.org/)' but I couldn't get putty to accept the passwords using ssh via the vbs script, so I ended up using [kitty.exe](https://download.cnet.com/KiTTY/3000-2155_4-10698301.html). Your mileage may vary.

I put kitty.exe in the C:\\Download\\ folder. If you put it somewhere else, change the script accordingly.

After creating the script(s) I run them in a task scheduler (I use [system scheduler](https://www.splinterware.com/products/scheduler.html)). 

Copy the text below and save it with the .vbs extension, and edit it; point it at the switches you want to backup.

Your mileage WILL vary. You will have to do a little work to get this to work, but the pay off is that you can automate the switch backups

Enjoy.

1159,t3_gep8ei,"We're in the middle of a NAS refresh and data migration project but I'm trying to see what options and/or methods are out there that might help me better answer an issue we've encountered in the past. I'm looking to see what solutions (Microsoft Server OS included or 3rd party) that may help me address monitoring disk space utilization.

Not so much looking to see what files/folders are taking up space but rather who/where data is getting dropped on to a file server.

We've previously had issues with seemingly free space disappearing in chunks for days at a time and then reappearing as free space. One day there will be 100GB and an hour later it may be down to 10GB and then days later it will be back to 100GB.

My suspicious is that different groups are moving data around (sometimes duplicating it), working through a process, and then either moving the sanitzed data again elsewhere. Management is seeing the data use and has tasked me to try and determine what may be happening.

I don't believe I'm going to find a a silver bullet product saying User A moved this much data to Location A...etc...etc....but maybe there is something to build some trends that can be analyzed and I can make a bit more sense. Guess I'm just checking to see how others out there maybe monitoring disk space utilization and usage?

I'm trying to figure out what's the best way to allow users to move between laptops and a remote desktop while preserving all or most of their settings, files etc. 

From what I've read, Roaming profiles will roam everything, UE-V will only roam what you ask for it (it was a redditor that posted that, sorry don't remember who). 

UEV sounds great, as my ""users"" are my kids in the scenario, and they have O365 through their school district. All of their schoolwork is saved on Teams/OneDrive/Sharepoint. 

But for things that are local, I can use one of the solutions above. UEV seems to be dead or dying? Looks like it's been in v2.1 for a while, with little to no update on documentation. Wondering if Microsoft abandoned this for the whole ""sign in with Microsoft to sync""

I also saw some where about setting up WorkFolders and folder redirecting to those. But would you redirect something like APPDATA to that? 

All of the threads that I saw were from the past (1 to 2yrs old). Has everyone just given up and used Microsoft accounts to sync things to the big data center in the sky? 

My kids don't have assigned laptops, and frequently switch. I also have a remote desktop that they can log into. Ideally, their settings/profiles would migrate from the laptop to the rd and vice versa.

* Every time the server boots it attempts a CHKDSK, which never seems to resolve
* Using Contig.exe I found the C:\\ disk very fragmented
* FSutil states the disk is in a dirty state
* Defrag isn't possible, I guess because it has this dirty state set and I guess you don't want to defrag a dirty disk anyway? Might just cause more issues?
   * Just for clarification the C:\\ doesn't appear in the drag GUI and command line doesn't allow it either

Everyone's jobs are being transferred to the new company, but a lot of us (possibly the majority) are not getting a proper job offer, just a 12 month contract. We have all been told that the intention is to hire us after this, but several of the people in the same group as me did get instant full offers.

What bothers me is that the people who did get the full offer work largely with our on-site stuff, while those of us who got contracts are remote employees who work more with AWS, me included. (The new company has a fair number of remote employees so I'm not worrying specifically about the intention being to get rid of all of our remote people, but more if it's targeted towards AWS people.) Our AWS infrastructure is on the complicated side and I'm the longest-standing employee who works primarily with it and probably have the best idea of how stuff fits together.

If the contract actually paid contractor money, I might be fine with it as I could actually save some up to cover a gap at the end, but right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck, and I'm getting paid basically the same with just a small increase which really isn't more than the inflation increase I would have otherwise got if my job had stayed the same (proper increases and bonuses were suspended due to the pandemic). In general I'm underpaid, while I like the culture and the people and it's too early to tell what the new company is like and how that might change, so I'm putting that aside for now.

I'm a bit wary of some changes that are clearly coming down the pipeline (e.g. they're Micro$oft Everything while we're largely open source based and free to use tools that don't suck), but what really bothers me is the 12 month contract. I work remotely largely because I'm stuck in a city that has almost no tech industry short of a few development sweatshops (local people who don't know shit about the tech industry love to claim there is one here, but there really isn't), and I don't want to end up screwed over a year from now having to compete with the whole country for remote jobs at short notice, as the only local jobs I can do are either monkey work for a third of the pay, or suit-wearing megacorps who would reject me as soon as I walked into the room. I'm a medium company person, who needs the kind of place where I can look how I want and have autonomy to use the right tools for the job, while still getting paid money I can actually live on.

Does anyone else have experience with being moved to a contract? Is this a red flag or something more common than I thought, and if so, why give full offers to some people and not others?

I hope to connect Outlook to both a G Suite account and an Exchange account.

Hoping everyone is safe and sound during the lockdown!

Linux newbie here (apologies for any incorrect terms or lack of verbose diagnostics), wondering if anyone out there can provide me a helping hand or steer me in the right direction.

**Background** \- We have a couple of Windows Server 2012 R2 file server running DFS (n and r), with multiple DFS shares. Our Linux estate mounts these shares using SMB with multi-user mode via NTLMSSPI. The idea being, the mount config is in fstab with creds of an account that simply just does the mounting. Whilst pam\_cifscreds passes the end-user credentials to the kernel keyring automatically at login. All this config is deployed and managed via puppet5.

OS = Ubuntu 18.04uname - a = 4.15.0-96-lowlatency #97-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Wed Apr 1 04:10:58 UTC 2020 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

Fstab:

    //fileshare/Share      /net/f  cifs    vers=3.02,multiuser,_netdev,sec=ntlmsspi,file_mode=0750,dir_mode=0755,credentials=/etc/samba/credentials    0       2

**Problem a)** User has created a service that simply does a kinit for a service account and then runs a ls on a mounted SMB shared /net/f to test mount reliability. It runs every hour to continuously poll the mount. (Now there could just be something wrong with this test itself but bear with me). It works for a short while but fails thereafter with:

    &lt;hostname&gt; run_test.sh[75853]: ls: cannot access '/net/f/Apps': Permission denied  

If I su as the service account running that script, and do a ls myself. /net/f, is there. Once I re-run the service after my su/ls, it resolves for a few hours. Then it fails again with the same error.

It's lead me to believe that it's the kernel keyring that's not right here?

The kern.log shows this log:

    [106415.123493] audit: type=1400 audit(1588686578.583:1933): apparmor=""ALLOWED"" operation=""open"" profile=""/usr/sbin/sssd"" name=""/run/systemd/users/835005388"" pid=64837 comm=""krb5_child"" requested_mask=""r"" denied_mask=""r"" fsuid=0 ouid=0
    [106415.158697] audit: type=1400 audit(1588686578.618:1934): apparmor=""ALLOWED"" operation=""file_mmap"" profile=""/usr/sbin/sssd"" name=""/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/krb5/plugins/authdata/sssd_pac_plugin.so"" pid=64837 comm=""krb5_child"" requested_mask=""m"" denied_mask=""m"" fsuid=835005388 ouid=0

**Problem b)**  (Different host but running the same mount config via fstab and SMB) Related to drive mounts again. We have another service account which isn't able to ls the same /net/f as above, but can get to the other mounts whilst we su. When we try to ls on /net/f, we get:

    ls: reading directory '.': Permission denied

I've tried to update the cifscreds details manually, a reboot, umount/mount. Still no luck. I think both issues are linked.

We've been using SMB 3.02 + NTLMSPPI previously but it was without the multi-user mode. The break glass solution for me is to revert the multi-user mode back to just using the mount creds as the access creds. I don't believe this is the right way to resolve it as it leaves a security hole.

My plead for help is two fold, how do others implement this? Secondly, what are we doing wrong? This was put in by our previous Linux Admin (not claiming to be one, just check my username).

Should I look into autofs and steer away from fstab? Or should I move from NTLMSPPI to Kerberos (previous admin said he couldn't find a solution for when Kerberos tickets expired as the kernel wasn't able to regenerate them, which led to shares timing out).

I appreciate any help, thanks for looking at my post :)

1216,t3_ge6yhu,"I do trust my work, I don't trust my memory.

This is going to be long, I apologize but right now I feel I have to talk about it to get past this stomach sick feeling. I'm stressed to my max right now, even thought of arguments about how this situation happened and how I'm only partly responsible.

I spent the last 3 months planning a reconfiguration of my NAS where my backups are stored. I had drive failures that was popping up at a freakishly high rate, 5 drives failed within 3 months. All drives were less than a year old.

I started prep to move my annual backups to make room for at least 3 weeks of backups so I can do my move with as little stress as possible.

I have 5 weeks worth of backups off site so I was covered for those, but I had no where to put my annual backups. I made room on our old retired nas systems and was able to move everything but this year's annual backup. I had to break those down in half and move half of the set of backup files onto one server and the other half onto another server. Needless to say I barely had room on 4 different devices for my backups, but I managed.

I was hoping to spend a week looking at the NAS and figuring out how to rebuild the raid the wy I wanted because 5/12 drives failed literally within 3 months, haven't figured out yet if it was bad drives or if something else killed the drives with the config. I was not expecting that, I had 4 drives set aside for failure and up until 2 weeks ago I still had 1 spare drive to keep me alive before all spares were used. We had no stand by drives because we couldn't afford it.

Well I couldn't wait any longer the day I decided to rebuild the nas for backups, the final drive gave out. Not too worried about it because I had already moved everything over to good locations.

Today I spent hours rebuilding the NAS and locating all of the old backups to move over but I couldn't find half of our annual backups. I panicked so bad, I'm feeling so sick to my stomach right now.

I made an emergency run to the office because I needed to know if I messed up or just being paranoid. Plugged one of the old nas in by USB, I wasn't expecting that it could hold the data that I was looking for but, there it was. All of the backups that I needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am heart racing, sweat pouring out of me, sick to my stomach from stress. I had a good idea that I'm not that reckless, I definitely wouldn't do something like that without making sure I had everything in order first. But in the moment, logic is out the window and panic sets in.

Thank god I spent 3 months working on this and triple checking my work as I went along. I truly think I would have ruined my reputation if I messed this up and most likely out of a job. The lesson I learned, always create a temporary document listing what work you did setting anything up. No matter how big or small the project is, document your work.

Documentation doesn't have to be about policy or procedures, sometimes having a progress log on your work even if you plan on deleting once the work is done can save your mental. I did not mess up today and its going to take me a while to come down off this stress.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Spent 3 months planning a project that would prevent a crisis with backups. Shortly after my prep was finished I hit breaking point and had to enact my plan before I had a chance to inventory where I had stored the backups. Rebuilding the backup system today and moving backups back to it, got a scare that I deleted 4 sets of year-end backups. Max panic set in and I went to my office to plug in our old backup system because I knew some files were moved there but I didn't expect all of them. Turns out all of the files I needed were on the old system that wasn't plugged in and if I had taken inventory of those backups then I wouldn't have panicked.

&amp;#x200B;

Also before anyone criticizes me about documentation, I had documentation on everything else for this project. I had documented how I was rebuilding the raid, total storage, number of spare drives, model numbers for each drive, even the names of folders for the file system where the backups would be kept. Everything but where the backups were stored temporarily, I didn't get a chance to do that before I had to dive into the rebuild.

I need a very simple tool that can alert me via e-mail when a server goes offline (aka unpingable) or the VPN tunnel goes down, or if there is a large amount of packet loss to a specific IP. That is the only features I really need. Just basic network monitoring. 

I know PRTG can do this as I have setup probes and alerts for various items... but, at least for me, the graphs are difficult to understand. I'd also get errors such as the below on a fairly regular basis which in short tells me nothing.

we have a windows 2003 based file server and are planning on migrating all files/folders onto a new VM build on either windows 2016 or windows 2019. i have done these file server migrations before, but not between 2 OS's where the gap between versions was so big. typically i would do the following

1-stand up new VM with available storage and append the word 'NEW' to the server name and join to the domain.

2-robocopy files+folders from old server to new server which preserves NTFS permissions

3-export  share permissions from existing server thru registry

4-import registry file to new server to apply share permissions

5-have some end users test file/permission access

1230,t3_geec6i,"Hey there,

First things first the details of the server,etc:

Windows Server 2003 (Basically used as a network drive only)   
Watchguard xtm 5 series (unsure of model, was configured by previous ISP to allow for simultaneous internet connections, it's no longer needed but for some reason have constant issues with internet when trying to remove it.)  
Vodafone NBN Modem  
few netgear network switches  
2 hot spots  


How the server is connected:  


Server PC plugs into wall socket, it's sent to another socket which then goes into the watchguard,

In the watchguard you have 3 cables (first cable is the server cable from the socket, second cable is the WAN cable from the NBN modem to the watchguard and the third cable is the uplink for our 2 hotspots connected by a PoE.

Now I would personally like to remove the watchguard altogether as it was initially just meant to load balance 2 adsl connections because we were unable to obtain any other type of internet until recent, however when unplugging the watchguard and simply plugging server into any of the switches with the modem and PoE cable doesn't seem to allow anything to work, plugging it back into the watchguard then somehow makes it all work? (this is not the case now as the TCP/IP details have been reset on the server and it's having communication issues), it was config'd remotely and the ISP won't give me anything in regards to how to to configure it myself or anything similar so it just sits there without any knowledge of how to use it or how to remove it.  


How the issue started:

Today I had some issues with a printers IP address stating that the IP address that it was using was already taken, so I had gone into our windows server 2003 and checked the DHCP and DNS to see if there was any devices taking the address, I could see that no device had taken its IP address or leased it, so I simply reset the printer assuming it would detect that no other device has the IP and simply use it but it still kept stating that the IP was in use.

I then went onto the windows 2003 machine and went to command prompt and did a basic flushdns to see if that would work and it didn't appear to do anything so I then did the following commands:

netsh int ip reset  
netsh winsock reset  
ipconfig /release  
ipconfig /renew  


now after this my server attempted to assign new details to its local area connection, it seemed to have deleted the TCP/IP settings that were set for the server to be on a static IP address and I can't remember the exact IP address the server was set to, I remember the gateway and such.

Now after I had done those commands the printer decided that the IP address was now free but then the wireless and all internet connections were lost.  


So far I have a small workaround, however it isn't what I'd like.

To achieve this workaround I set my IP address of the windows 2003 server to the same as the gateway ([192.168.1.250](https://192.168.1.250)) and I am able to achieve internet on some devices by ethernet (a few are limited and unable to get an ip address) as well as wireless however the server itself is unable to access the internet and wireless devices are unable to access the shared drives or print to the printers, so I change the IP address to [192.168.1.252](https://192.168.1.252) (same as the gateway) to see if that allows for any network drive access, the internet access for the Ethernet and wireless connections remain however access to the shared folders and printers are then not working, also windows 2003 server pc constantly spits out that is has an IP address conflict when changed to 1.252.

If I change the IP address to be anything but 1.250 or 1.252 it doesn't give internet or shared drive access to the ethernet or wireless connections. 

Ideally I just want to be able to access my shared network drives via the wireless internet again, but this has been the biggest headcase today all because a printer wanted to claim its ip address was a duplicate.

Now I am without internet to over 90% of the devices in the business and the network drive is only accessible via one computer that is connected via Ethernet.

Basically, using VEEAM we are taking incremental backups during the week, and full VBK backups on the weekends. These jobs run successfully, and successfully transfer to our Synology NAS for safe storage. We are avoiding HyperBackup as those files are uploaded in a proprietary format and require downloading back to the Synology to be able to restore. Also old backups would never get removed from the HyperBackup system causing Azure storage usage to skyrocket. 

I’ve been attempting to use Rclone from the Synology terminal on the two volumes we store backups to. This works for everything, except our Windows VBK/VIB file which are 5.7TB and 4.1TB respectively. With those file sizes in mind Azure has blob size limits that we seemingly cannot get around. My limited and only very recent experience within this platform is probably rearing it’s ugly head here.

Are there alternatives to using full VBK backups to get around these Azure limitations?

I have about 40servers in my win environment, most of them running tls1.1, yea  I know. Trust me I know. I was tasked to get them all set to tls1.2 but since most of them are prod servers with no dev, I’m having to work with each business unit to make the changes. 

Was going along smoothly until I hit a handful of servers that keep reverting the registry settings and they will enable tls1.1 and 1.2 even after reboot when I disable 1.1. 

Now I have check gpos, logon scripts, etc. I even took one of the servers and during downtime I killed the application services, set them to manual, made the reg change and then rebooted. Same issue. Tls1.1 enables after reboot. 

I have never seen this behavior for only a handful of servers when all servers are running the same gpo set. I even moved one of them to a no-harden test ou to strip all gpos and still no dice.

Our users do not have any priveledged permissions and unfortunately our VPN is configured to disconnect when logging into a second profile (authenticates using a user cert), so 1st level would need to rely on cached credentials through the remote admin application (ConnectWise Access) we are using to log into his account for admin functions.

Except for the one mentioned on this subreddit, who had an incompatible drive, as in it was not on the LSI Gen2 list of compatible drives. However, in my case it is, and yet it still remains seen as Unconfigured (Good) Unsupported. I'm running an LSI 9260-4i connected to 4 Seagate ST900MM0006 10K.6 SAS drives. And although they are shown to be compatible on the Gen2 compatibility list, ([https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/MegaRAID-SAS-Gen2CompatibilityList](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/MegaRAID-SAS-Gen2CompatibilityList)), the controller refuses to work with the drives, and upon attempting to create a RAID volume, it fails. Even after a firmware update to the latest firmware (circa 2015) it still doesn't work. Now, I thought it could be the fact that on the list of compatible drives, it notes the firmware, and for my drive, it notes firmware A001, however, my drives list firmware 4F08. Could this be it? Surely they can't expect you to have the *exact* same firmware on the list, right? Even if that's so, the date code on my drives says ""15333"" which translates to Feb 16, 2015 when the latest firmware for the controller came out sometime in August of 2015. That seems pretty close in terms of time for them to not support it because it's obsolete. I have put in a ticket with LSI, but they are responding very slowly. Took them about a day for them to respond after putting in the ticket, back with the command to run their logging script, and that was Monday, April 27th. I replied to them with the results on Tuesday, and haven't heard anything since. I also called them, but it went right to voicemail. Maybe they're out for corona? But I did get one response from them so I'm not sure. I've also emailed Seagate to see if maybe the A001 firmware for some reason isn't listed on their site, as after searching for available firmware for my drives, nothing is listed.

We have a couple site-to-site VPNs that we use for our customers. We typically provide a set of specifications regarding algorithms and key sizes, but tunnel addressing as always been something unique and negotiated for each customer.

I know this is decided on a case-by-case basis, but when you set up a VPN with an external business (vendor / customer), do you typically provide:  

* The literal IP / Subnets used on your network (providing there's no overlap between both networks)
* A translated internal IP for the traffic to pass through
* A translated external IP for traffic.

We've tried setting up tunnels using a translated internal IP on both sides of the VPN to prevent addressing conflicts, but we typically run into issues with customers not knowing / unable to set up an address translation. This makes me wonder if it's not commonly used.

SYMPTOMS:
-Machines unable to service logon requests to non-cached profiles.
-Cached profiles' passwords not matching other machines which DO have DC connectivity (usually this is the first symptom).

Okay, it's an issue talking to the DC. Yes and no:

-Can ping domain controller, but cannot resolve through DNS.
-DNS, when it DOES resolve, does so to an external address, which I have tracked down as our marketing firm.
-Some machines work, others do not. It does not appear to be a function of hardware, as far as I can tell.
-Affected machines removed from the domain cannot rejoin (AD DC could not be contacted).
-Affected machines removed from the domain can access the internet and perform normally.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
-Looked at, modified DNS servers, default gateways, etc. Everything seems to be in order. Machines point to DC, DC points to router, router points to outside world (8's)
-DNS Records *look* okay, but this is where my expertise is limited. I've checked the things I've been told to check, and nothing references anything unexpected, but I have no reverse lookup zones (that's never been a problem, before).
-Altered the DCHP scope, which may or may not have anything to do with it. No change to any machine's status.

Troubleshooting I've considered:
-Wipe-and-loading a machine and seeing if the issue persists.
-Blowing away my DNS service and reinstalling it.
-Quietly contemplating the choices I've made with my life.
-Setting the comm closet on fire.

Help me. I'm having a bunch of other issues, but I think they all seem to relate in some way back to this: Printers accessible and inaccessible, depending on the day and their mood, file share requiring and not requiring a password to access (by default it does not, once authenticated), etc.

I realize this is probably basic. I get it, I do. But I want to learn. I've tried to learn. What am I missing?!

Edit: I may not have been especially clear about this detail, but my domain resolving to an external IP address hosted by our marketing firm happens both internally and externally to our network, and that if one were to type companyinternaldomain.com into a browser from anywhere, it would redirect them to companyexternalwebsite.com... Maybe that information is useful, maybe not.

1273,t3_ge06aw,"Hi

I'm trying to get Always on VPN working properly, I've been following the guide on the MS website and everything has worked as it should until the very end.

When I'm testing the VPN connection on a windows 10 machine it connects straight away using the local certificate on the machine. The issue I'm having it the fact it's not using the NPS server.

I was under the impression you have the certificates installed and it then connects to the VPN server which then checks your AD account is in the correct group before allowing you to connect. I can turn the NPS server off completely and still connect so it doesn't seem to be doing that check

The authentication provider on the VPN server is set to Radius with the correct details in there

1274,t3_ge4ctd,"Not sure if anyone else has been in this place; but reading through the CJIS requirements for credentials/password policies. We're using AD; and I am pretty sure that means we cannot meet the modern password requirements specified by CJIS. Reading into the latest NIST guideline; hit the same requirement issue. ""Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function""

My understanding is that AD hashes (weakly) the credentials, but they're not actually stored. That means we can't meet these requirements, correct? And I assume anyone else on AD also wouldnt be able to; unless there's another control I'm not thinking of?

Anyways, I don't know much about telephony, and I was tasked with figuring out how we could all call from our personal cell phones but have the phone number pop up as our companies number, or at least a generic shared number. From what I can tell our Mitel 5000 phone system can't do this. Is there any online phone bank type service I could use? Basically we want to call from our personal cell phones to a central number, then dial the customers from that number. 

Best part is, I just found out about this a few minutes ago and they want to start making calls today. So I haven't done much other than precursory googling, most of what I am finding that might do it is focused around political calls, much more complicated than we need it to be, and expensive. Any advice/info would be appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks for the info so far, as I am the only one working on this and then will have to train the end users I may just have to go with the google voice option to hide our real numbers, but with no way for a central number. It appears Callhub.io will do what I want at a cost, but I still am not sure how long that will take to set up. Also there were some suggestions with my Mitel system, there are a few IP phones on it so we pay for those licenses but for the most part they are digital phones hardwired in. So I can't easily add softphones to my phone system either, as they require more licenses (which the cost of will not be approved).",Phone system software,r/sysadmin,0.72,6,1588714201.0,30,1

1280,t3_ge0t8u,"**Background:** The Company I work for received new Dell 5400 and 5500s that have intermittent issues connecting to Skype for Business (365) (issue was replicated on multiple versions) on a WiFi connection while working from home connected through our VPN. **Our other laptops from Dell have no issues**. The users that get the issue will either get stuck on the main login screen for Skype on “signing in” or they get passed the sign in screen and just see themselves and everyone else as “**Presence Unknown**” (example [https://filestore.community.support.mic ... b040e2f735](https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0adafef0-7352-4ac7-b004-51b040e2f735))

The laptops have no issues connecting to skype when using a wired Ethernet connection either in the office or at home via VPN. The issue occurs when the user brings their laptop home and connects to their Wi-Fi then to our VPN and tried to sign into skype. This could last up to 90 minutes before finally signing in.

We have already confirmed it is not the VPN causing this issue as our network team ran some tests and confirmed it.We have tried clearing the SIP profile, other user accounts, other Wi-Fi networks, updating the Skype version and nothing worked.

What Temporarily Worked: We thought we had it when we updated the Intel 9560 Wireless Drivers as it worked initially, but a few days to a week later the issue returned. Going into the **Device Manager Advanced Settings** for the Wireless card and changing the **Mimo Power Save Mode** to **Dynamic SMPS** then back to Auto SMPS actually fixes the issue and lets the sign into Skype, but only for a few days as well.

Skype for Business is the only application that is affected by this on our new systems. It seems that the WiFi Card, Skype, and our VPN are not working together and it is becoming harder to pinpoint the issue.

We thought the whole batch was flawed, and tier 1 support at Dell actually wanted us to send them back. But we pursued the issue and got to a higher tier of support where we were informed that what we thought was a bug or problem is actually by design and part of the energy star/energy efficiency feature of the laptop.

Essentially, immediately after booting up the laptop, while it is at the login screen, it will sleep after 1 minute. If you log into Windows, the laptop will sleep after 4 minutes. You can not override this with the Window 10's power settings. So if you set the laptop to never sleep, or to sleep after a half hour, it will still zonk out at 4 minutes.

Sleeping is baked into the hardware, and there is no way dictate when the laptop sleeps, is what we were told. There is a setting in the BIOS where you can completely block sleep all together. But that does exactly what it says, it removes sleep as an option completely.

Have any of you run into this? It is making remote support a real pain. We usually set our Win10 machines to ""never"" sleep when plugged in. But now they go night-night after 4 minutes no matter what. Which means we have a 4 minute window to jump on a machine remotely and catch it before it goes to sleep. It's hard to impossible in most situations.

I am currently working on a physical authentication factor (MFA) based on location for cloud hosted services.  


The idea is to authenticate access to certain services using a classical password, and a defined location (e.g. company premises). The location-based authentication factor works by using a physical authenticator whose location is determined by one or more beacons placed in the premises of a company.  


This technology would allow staff to access certain services (can be critical) only from defined, trusted locations  
It could also ease the management of cloud access for short-term collaborators (e.g. visiting partners from another company, consultants…) by granting an access which is only valid in the company’s premises.

I have installed one Exchange 2016 a couple of months ago for journaling only.

This week I have installed two additional Exchange 2016 for a migration from 2010. Everything is working well, however since I have 3 Exchange 2016 in total my migrated mailbox tries to send mails over the dedicated journaling Exchange as well.

So I have server A for journaling and server B and C for actual mail flow ingoing and outgoing. I am not quite sure how to configure server A to only do journaling and not be used as a hop for sending internal messages. Do I just have to disable the receive connectors? Or create a dedicated connector for internal messages?

One of the things we have set up is WSUS server. Since we don't have the fastest internet connection, the idea was that we would save bandwidth by having the WSUS server download the updates centrally. However, this was a disaster since we massively underestimated the amount of disk space a WSUS server requires. Also, without careful configuration it downloads a lot more than needed. Finally, we were never using it in the way intended, that is controlling who gets which update when - we just had no time to set up a test group, but instead approved all updates immediately. So we got rid of WSUS for the time being ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .

However, we would still like to be able to have an overview of which computer is requiring updates, and be able to trigger updates remotely if needed. Can you guys recommend a tool for this?

I just imagine a big listview with all computers in the domain, the current update state, and the option to start the update now.

1351,t3_gdetq0,"Hi all,

Little backstory:
I've been working at a ig company for 3 years now. I was hired as an application administrator and made my way to ""Linux System Administrator"" which is my official title now. I'm a self-taught admin, I've loved sys stuff, programming and PC in general since my teenage years. I've written some C# and Python libraries and utilities and I'm an active homelabber.

I was hired when my company decided to form a ops team to help the devs on inner source project to manage all the ops side of thing so basically managing and deploying server, automating deployment and configuration with Chef, monitoring and bringing front line support for users (within the company). 

Fast-forward to now, market is trending a lot toward devops workflow. We are currently working with devs on a development platform project. As other apps, we are in charge of providing the monitoring. Since this app is hosted on Kubernetes, we can't monitor with an agent like we used to, so we are instead discussing how to forward alerts to MS Teams using a webhook. This needs a forwarder to be set to receive alerts and forward them to the needed channel.

I did a POC on a dev cluster of ours and have a working solution I presented today. The solution works for them, but my issue here is that it was pushed by their IT project manager that I (our team) should be the one making the integration to their platform.

I've spoken with one of the devs to have an idea of what were the implications of that. It involves, in my opinion, quite a bit of dev, learning jsonnet (I already know the basics but this is advanced usage) to generate the manifests and fit all these into the makefiles they use to deploy. I think I can reasonnably pull it in about a week, considering all the learning needed and that I can't put 100% of my time on it since some important ticket will come once in a while.

Now, I'm someone who really likes to learn new technologies, languages and such. I taught myself programming, scripting and other techs like Kubernetes, but I think this goes out of my scope. I spoke with my collegues about it(we are a team of 3 guys), they all agree with me but think I might as well do it to prove that what will take me a week would take one of their devs a few hours.

Their(the dev team) point is that to be able to support the platform correctly, I should understand how pieces are interacting with each others.

I find this to be a valid point, but I fail to see where the integration of components fits my job description and my expertise. I've approached my manager about it before and he was agreeing with me but it seems to be a recurring theme, and the line is hard to draw. I don't want to look like the guy who doesn't want to improve, as it's totally not the case but I fear setting a precedent.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'd love to hear your opinions on this. Let me know if anything isn't clear.",Where to draw the line between ops and dev in devops,r/sysadmin,0.71,8,1588638717.0,17,1

First i hope that everyone is doing well!  

I have a small project in my company to migrate all the dropbox team folders to google drive shared drive.  

We are using google suite so there is no need to use and pay for dropbox as a cloud storage where we can use  Google drive for it.  

I have been searching and exploring ways how to make this migration as smooth as possible and with not to much manual work but i can't find away how to export the users and their permissions from a dropbox team folder, i have already asked dropbox support and they don't offer such a feature.  

I can do the data migration easily by syncing the dropbox team folder with Dropbox Desktop app and then from there drag and drop the folder to Shared drive in Google, easily done!  

The hard part is migrating  the users and their corresponding permissions for the Dropbox Team folder,i am talking about folders that have hundred of files inside and doing this manually will take me ages.  

The other problem is that file permissions are different from drive to dropbox, in dropbox you are able to share a subfolder inside the main Team folder  while in drive you are able to share only files inside the main folder and not subfolders .

My company is trying to implement an application for web content filtering, currently we are in the testing phase of deployment. The application is capable of looking at AD security groups and from those applying different filter groups set up in the application console. The way the application gathers information on which group the logged on user is a part of is by scraping the results for the command ""gpresult /r"". Now for the fun part...

Since all our users are working from home right now, they need to connect to a VPN before they are actually connected to the company domain and pull up-to-date group membership for the user account. They can only connect to the VPN after they log into their computer. Because group membership is only pulled to the computer on user login, and the computer must be able to reach out to a domain controller to get updated group membership, the results from ""gpresult /r"" does not include updated group membership. Because the group membership is not updated in those results, the application is not applying any web filter policies to the machine.

So with that, here is what I have tried so far:

From what I could find, group membership is exclusively update on user login, and only if the computer is able to reach out to a domain controller for updated group membership at the time of login. I have confirmed that this is true through logging in on one account, connecting to the VPN, switching users, and logging in to a separate account while on the VPN. When running a gpresult /r under these circumstances, everything works fine.

HOWEVER, there are people that suggest there is a way to get group membership to refresh AFTER logging in. The methods for doing so include using the commands ""gpupdate /force"", ""klist /purge"", and by killing explorer.exe and starting it again running as the user. Unfortunately, every combination and method that I have used with any of these methods does not update the group membership listed in ""gpresult /r""

So with all that said, I have two questions if any of you fine IT professions know.

Where exactly does ""gpresult /r"" gather its data on the group membership of the logged on user? Is it somewhere in the registry, a Kerberos ticket, or somewhere else?

2. in [protection.office.com/antispam](https://protection.office.com/antispam) I've ensured that the server's IP is in the IP allow list of the Connection Filter Policy
3. In [protection.office.com/antispam](https://protection.office.com/antispam) I've ensured that the server is set to 'allow spoofing' within the Spoof Intelligence policy.
4. In DNS/SPF I've ensured that the sending IP address has been added in an 'include' statement.
5. In [protection.office.com/antispam](https://protection.office.com/antispam) I've ensured that the bulk email threshold is set to '7' which is the default.
6. In [outlook.office365.com/ecp](https://outlook.office365.com/ecp) I've gone so far as to add a Spam Filter Bypass rule by setting that '[server@ourdomain.com](mailto:server@ourdomain.com)' gets the SCL value of -1 and is skipped over for the Spam Filter.
7. Mail is passing the SPF check
8. User has no special transport rules in place that might cause the issue

Despite  all that, the email gets sent, received by our system, bypasses the  spam filter, gets an SCL rating of 6 and is immediately routed to  Quarantine. What I find puzzling about the whole thing is how it can  bypass the spam filter (verified by checking mail flow) but come out the  other end with an SCL 6 (verified by the header)?

* DCs hosted on an Azure VM that is connected by S2S VPN.
* Able to RDP into the VM using the internal 192.168 address.
* Network Security Group assigned to the VM has ports 1812 and 1813 allowed for both TCP &amp; UDP for both inbound &amp; outbound.
* DC firewall rules allow 1812 and 1813 in on UDP (automatically created by adding the NPS role)
* VM responds to ping from cmd so it is reachable.
* nmap shows TCP 1812 as filtered and UDP 1812 as open|filtered.
* Trying to authenticate into the wireless network (thus attempting to use the NPS server) does not generate any log files on the server--leading me to believe that the problem exists before even getting to the NPS server.

The issue I'm having is that we replaced our core NSA at our parent company's behest a week ago.

I've checked and each tunnel has basically a miniscule amount of data coming through in any 24 hour period. Problem is that since the NSA has gone in, this server's performance grinds to a halt periodically throughout the day. The disks just max out and the server is completely locked up for 10-15 minutes, and then clears right up. This wasn't an issue with the old networking gear.

I was pulled in the middle of a project that I'm not all too familiar with, namely controlled validation process of a hybrid azure AD join rollout with AD FS in their environment.

The document above states the following:

\----------------------------

To do a controlled validation of hybrid Azure AD join on Windows current devices, you need to:

1. Clear the Service Connection Point (SCP) entry from Active Directory (AD) if it exists
2. Configure client-side registry setting for SCP on your domain-joined computers using a Group Policy Object (GPO)
3. If you are using AD FS, you must also configure the client-side registry setting for SCP on your AD FS server using a GPO
4. You may also need to [customize synchronization options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-post-installation#additional-tasks-available-in-azure-ad-connect) in Azure AD Connect to enable device synchronization.

\------------------------

Has anyone gone through this process before?  Is the Microsoft documentation sufficient for guidance on this topic, or is there more to it?

His name was common enough that checking obituaries hasn't really helped either. While I didn't know him all that well personally, I wanted to share how I knew him professionally. We'll call him Bill.

Bill joined the project a few months ago which entailed upgrading all of a client's Server 2008 machines and my role was as an advisor who knew the most about the client's environment. The project was described to him of just doing the engineering of performing the upgrades and maybe working with users or vendors, but the reality was much different. The client didn't know their environment well and it would fall to us to discover all their servers, validate the hardware, determine applications/function, confirm that with the application owner, plan out an upgrade path, and then perform the actual work. Despite a couple of grumbles, Bill took it in stride and took on a more leadership role without being asked.

He helped us come up with how we were going to document everything, assisted the other contractors, came up with email templates, always worked on improving processes, and setup a software repository with ISOs and installation media for us to work out of. He rolled out a slew of scripts and tools he had used on previous projects such as the MAP tool and was able to use that to help supplement the information that we did have. He helped clean up their AD by removing all old DCs/metadata, upgraded all existing DCs, cleaned up their RDS licensing infrastructure, actually setup a KMS server and corrected all of the wrong product keys, uplifted their domain functionality, and moved them to DFSR for replication. All of this really fell into a gray area as far as the scope of the project, but Bill knew the importance of having a healthy environment to go into and was all about best practices. Honestly, I'm not sure any of those things would have happened if it hadn't been for him and was in addition to all the upgrades and decommissions he performed. I was never concerned I'd have to double-check his work and really appreciated his help with the project.

Bill understandably had some frustrations that he expressed to me and I know it caused him some stress and anxiety. The client's environment and ""best practices"" can't be used in the same sentence which didn't sit well with him. A lot of the things you might take for granted just aren't in place and he was constantly hitting roadblocks. I did my best to commiserate and make sure that he knew I appreciated him, but I knew it bothered him just the same. I had grown used to and somewhat blind to it having worked with the client for so long.

I guess I just wanted to share how much I appreciated him. He was a man who took pride in his work, was always willing to help, and was always looking to improve things. My only hope is that this project wasn't a contributing factor to his passing. I wouldn't think that it was affecting him too bad, but I just can't be sure.

Wonder if any of you have any ideas or help on this one. We've been in the process of moving office, and due to the current climate have had to resort to installing our internal office rack into a datacentre.

So, the setup goes Patch ports - USG - 48 port Unifi switch - 2 servers running off the back of that.

The patch ports with allocated IP's are connected to WAN1 and 2 on the USG. Lan on USG to Switch port 1, rest is off the switch.

We get no internet connectivity to the USG what so ever. Have gone though everything we can think of. USG reset, ARP tables and MAC's. Multitude of reboots. quadruple checking DNS and Gateways settings. Setting static IP's. this has been going on all weekend.

This issue has been posted 1000 times, but I can't find an answer that suits my situation.  
I have a esxi hypervisor with two VMs running 2012R2, both of which show ""No Internet"", even though internet works fine.  
The only reason this is even an issue is because one of them is a TS, and is causing Outlook/Office not to activate because it thinks there's no internet connection.

I have checked to make sure both servers can access the internet testing site, and retrieve the txt file successfully - for all intents and purposes the machines SHOULD show as online.

I have tried so many things now - including disabling IPV6 (which seemed to work for a bit until the problem returned a few days later).  
I have also tried resetting winsock and performing the netsh int ip reset commands (which didn't help at all).

Other machines on the network seem fine, so I think it could be NIC related.

Additionally, both VMs are using different kinds of NIC - one is e1000e, and the other is a VMX3 NIC.

Both seem to behave the same way in this case.

Let me elaborate on my confusing title. I want to set default applications at a GPO level which is all fine.

I was thinking that perhaps it would read the xml file sequentially and if I had the Reader association first, it would set that, then right under the Read association I have the line for the Adobe Standard association so if the computer has that installed I assumed it would default it to Standard and if not leave it at Reader.

This is going to be a very long post but my recent experience should stand as a warning to IT managers about outsourcing. I'm not totally against it in certain situations, I tend think it can work in two scenarios. When an IT team doesn't have the expertise or resources to do something cost effectively, I don't think it’s bad to outsource it but it should be a partnership just like any other vendor. The other situation is when a business is clueless, numerous people on this sub reddit have encountered a situation where they're the first real IT person, a bad MSP left a business out to dry, or you're taking over from a hostile and/or incompetent solo admin. 

I've used the same outsourcing companies for the last 5 years. One out of Bangladesh are a smaller family business less than 200 people, they invest in their staff, and from the get go the internal IT team was in control. It was well understood that we brought them onto support us not compete or replace us.

The relationship works and we've expanded our services with them as needed. 

This is in stark contrast to my recent experience with a large vampire IT consulting/outsourcing company. My company is large enough that IT teams become silos and have separate IT managers. One IT manager who previously worked for this vampire company made enough noise that he got approval to experiment with outsourcing the business unit he ran. Three and half months later they got booted for failing to provide adequate support

In my opinion I think the now former IT manager and vampire project managers did not really understand how you would operate an IT department or have situational awareness. They put way too much emphasis on ""metrics"" and cost cutting so they could get their bonus. I think they took full advantage of decision makers not being technical and made promises that were not realistic. Unfortunately for them this behavior lost them a customer we're not Barclays large but losing thousands of dollars does not bode well for them. 

Here's a lay down of all their warning signs.

1. They insisted on rushing through the takeover with no transition period

2. No information gathering was conducted by the vampires. They didn't ask exiting employees about their day to day job or for documentation. (I wound up doing this independently bribing people with pizza and drinks to get information because I suspected their failures would eventually fall back to the internal IT teams)

3. Competent IT people from the vampire company who were initially part of the project were either removed for pushing back or must have asked to be reassigned. Perfect example is day one of the hand off the vampires would be handling a particular support desk. An engineer brought up this wasn't plausible because they wouldn't have access to all the systems, and didn't have domain accounts yet. This person was no longer involved in the project after that conference call.

4. Vampire staff were extremely rigid on what they could and could not do. Everything is hidden behind bureaucracy and ticket tennis. Any issue requires unnecessary steps and people getting on a conference call. People treated the calls like echo chambers constantly asking the person next to them for guidance or permission to do something. This sometimes would go on for days. Laughably in one instance after my team discovered a security bug, a vampire joined a call huffing and puffing domineeringly telling a pm that my team needed to join the conference call to approve a change. I had to stifle laughter as I pointed out that we originally started the phone call and opened the support ticket to implement a patch because her team controls the maintenance of the application.

The final warning is kind of a story in itself but I think it’s worth mentioning what actually got this company fired. This business unit had a mainframe administrator who was part of the layoff let’s call him Popeye Doyle. Popeye Doyle had 40 years on the job, only career he's ever had. The day he finds out about the layoff he goes to HR and says I'm not interested in being out sourced or applying for a job at the vampire company. He told them I've maintained the mainframe without interference for years and without a problem. Either we work something out were I remain an employee of the current company or today is my last day I will retire rather than be outsourced. The vampires and the IT manager don't even meet Popeye Doyle half way. I know most of the time outsourcing decisions are made independently of IT and it’s out their control but I've been the primary technical person responsible for preventing/resolving several potential IT disasters in my tenure here. So I have some clout with execs. I warned the CISO and CFO that the vampires were flirting with disaster by firing Popeye Doyle and they needed to cover every square inch of their ass and plan accordingly if they wanted to survive the blast radius. I did my best to sound the alarm with the vampires that they were making a huge mistake. Eventually I dropped all civility in my emails sending something along these lines of: 

*“You guys have no choice but to come to a work agreement with Popeye Doyle, we cannot support this technology, we do not have a support person, I haven't seen evidence vampire company has a resource either, we don't know what core services are on that mainframe or how one would even logon. Frankly if something went wrong and we needed to get a consultant I'm not sure where we could find one, and how soon a consultant could realistically travel to fix the problem with the pandemic ongoing.”* The Vampire's response was so funny I printed it out and tapped it on a wall in my home office.

*"" Hello Lemmy Caution, you'll find that Vampire company has a lot of experience on these handover projects I know there’s always lot of friction and concern initially but we strive ourselves on providing customers with the best resources and you'll soon see we can provide more with less""*

You can imagine how this went. We were already not happy with the service we were getting but then Con Edison in New York accidentally drilled too deep into the street during maintenance and cut power to our building for almost two full days. Not a big deal we just an organized a shut down when it became obvious the outage would last longer than the UPS batteries. Except for the first time in 40 years we didn't have Popeye Doyle there to restart the mainframe. Turns out those mainframes contained a payroll system, payment process system, and a record application for a certificate program we issue anyone could call us and ask if we could validate that a person completed this certificate program. Once it became obvious we could be facing fines and serious trouble from the certificate issuing board the vampires went into full blown panic mode. They actually tried sending email blasts all over their global operation to try and find someone who could fix it. They brought in several consultants from other sections of the vampire operation but couldn't fix it. The full outage lasted seven days until they caved and called Popeye Doyle who basically got a down payment on a beach house somewhere in Pacifica, California for fixing the issue. This outage got the IT manager fired and the service agreement canceled apparently there’s a clause about the vampires being responsible for monetary loss &amp; errors/omissions but most importantly my company learned an expensive lesson on bad IT management/outsourcing.",Encountered IT Outsourcing Bad Practices Recently,r/sysadmin,0.95,144,1588518539.0,80,1

I told him we hadn't put it together because it was the dumbest thing I've ever heard, which seemed to tick him off.

&amp;#x200B;

Situation: I have a Primary Domain Controller (2012 r2) that holds all the fsmo roles and its dying.

I have a handful of other vm domain controllers of which only 1 remains intact. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some research I realized the the fastest and headache-free way of saving this situation would be to transfer the fsmo roles of the physical domain controller to the surviving Virtual DC. Then spin up new dc's from scratch and let them replicate of this new fsmo king. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I plan to accomplish this: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transfer fsmo roles from the phsyical DC to the existing virtual DC. 
2. Demote physical DC
3. Instead of restoring VM DC's just create new DC's and have them pull the data from the VM now holding the fsmo roles. 
4. Clear the metadata of the decommissioned dc using ntdsutil.
5. Remove reference of removed server from DNS. 
6. Delete removed server from Sites and Services. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the other vm dc's they won't power on. So is there any special process I have to do to scrub them or will steps 4-6 work for them too ?

Oracle (Cloud). These certs all not that useful, but hey, I'll basically take anything when it's free. You can take each exam once. Must complete all tests by 5/15/20. 

Update: I'm not able to see open exam slots for most of these anymore. It's unlikely you will be able to register for an Oracle exam at this point. Seems they’re booked up. 

Free exams available (on Pearson Vue): 

Oracle Autonomous Database Specialist  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Operations Associate  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Developer Associate
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Associate
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Professional

All multiple choice exams. 

---------------------------

Juniper Networks. Juniper's ""Open Learning"" program always allows you to earn free associate level exam certs (one time per track; there's 5 tracks). JNCIA-Junos is the hardest to get access to as it requires enrolling in a web course to earn the voucher. 

You can earn the other ones (JNCDA, JNCIA-Cloud, etc) through Junos Genius. You do have to complete the exam within 3 months of earning the free voucher. No rush on this in general though it's been available for a couple years now. Earning a JNCIA cert automatically extends expiration on all other JNCIA Juniper certs you have. So good to space these out over a few years. Multiple choice. Pearson Vue. 

Here's direct links to the Juniper options:

JNCIA-JUNOS: This one requires a special registration session and is capacity controlled. You can sign up for the 10/2020 session here while spaces are still open: https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=10175

This afternoon, just a couple of hours ago, I started a migration and according to O365 migration status page, they've already transferred around **5 GB** from each Google account. That's 5 GB per user, in a couple of hours. I started with a small batch of only 2 users, to test it out.

I have more users and I plan to do another batch right after the first one finishes. The next users have quite the large mailboxes (+20 GB). I would like to know what can i expect while migrating. Will i hit any kind of hard limit and be blocked or throttled?

I'll  be honest.  I know nothing about IT.

So my question is, what  information is my company getting access to, by me installing Rapid7 client on my  computer.

Installing a CA-less FreeIPA server (on Linux) with self-signed certificates: feasible?

# Answer (for [FreeIPA server Ubuntu 18.04 package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/net/freeipa-server) install) = ""yes""

After generating `root_or_intermediate_CA.pem`, `ipa_http.p12` ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS\_12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) ) and feeding these files into the following `ipa-server-install` command, we have a *working* (confirmed in our environment) [CA-less FreeIPA server](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V3/CA-less_install) on Ubuntu 18.04... with the following workarounds to correct FreeIPA-on-Ubuntu-18.04 problems:

***FreeIPA bug workarounds*** *(for this system contexts; see versions below)*:

1. Prior to running `ipa-server-install`: [downgrade python's pyasn1 and pyasn1-modules](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyasn1/+bug/1785157).  ([Apparently fixed in FreeIPA 7.4.1](https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/7685#comment-533776); FreeIPA 4.6.90 is currently packaged with Ubuntu 18.04.4 per system info below.)
2. After running `ipa-server-install`:

* `sudo chmod 775 /var/lib/krb5kdc` (per [this bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/freeipa/+bug/1772447))
* *Optional:* `sudo chmod o+r /var/lib/ipa-client/pki/*.pem`  (apparently needed only when NOT running CA-less FreeIPA)

The `--dirsrv-pin=` and `--http-pin=` paraemters, with no value after the equal sign, appear to be required to signal `ipa-server-install` that the private keys embedded in the `.p12` file have no password/PIN protection. Note also that the `dirsrv` and `http` cert parameters both read the *same* `.p12` file.

    $ ipa-server-install            \
    --unattended                    \
    --dirsrv-cert-file=ipa_http.p12 \

I also have created test folders to test it: Share permission is on ""Everyone"" with full access. NTFS permission is not inherited.

The original profile has a Home folder assigned where originally the path was established using the %username% variable. The User profile created creates a folder named %username% instead of using the users logon name.

What I'm try to do is maximize data transfer rates between two single Windows Server 2016 servers.

The servers have 4 x 1Gb network ports, Windows Server 2016 is installed on 2 SSDs in RAID1.  The SSDs are supposed to support up to 6Gbps transfer rates.  I've tried creating NIC teams with lbfoadmin as well as Switch Embedded Teaming.  Using these limits single host to single host transfers to 1Gbps.  (Though it does allow 4 x 1Gbps transfers if they are to 4 separate hosts).  I've also tried letting the 4 NICs operate independently, not in a team, and let SMB3 multichannel and RSS handle the transfers.  This has had the best results so far, even though each NIC only transferred around 600Mbps for some reason.  Unfortunately the network adapters do not support RDMA so I can't take advantage of that.

From what I've read the networking options will have the same limitation of NIC teaming.  LAG, etc, will permit multiple 1Gbps transfers but the max between two hosts is 1Gbps.

I'm not entirely sure this is the right sub to post this question, if not: please ignore :) I've tried my luck in r/ProWordPress, but got stuck there, as it is a server-specific issue.

I am a web developer, and I've rebuilt the website for a scientific institute here in the Netherlands. It is a WordPress website, where I've built a fully customized back end with Advanced Custom Fields Pro ( [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) ).

This works great in my dev environment. However, after migration to the institute's server, Advanced Custom Fields can not save / update any field data. ACF support has helped me as much as they could, escalating the issue to the plugin developer, and his final findings were this:

""I have added some code to the ACF PRO plugin that will log out information during the ""save\_post"" action. This action should be triggered in two AJAX calls, however, on this site, it is only triggered once.

This explains why ACF is not able to update it's metadata.

As this issue only exists on a specific server, I believe it is safe to say that there is a ""security"" trigger or something similar at play preventing that 2nd AJAX call.""

I'm wondering if someone from this sub could give me any pointers where to look for the cause of this issue, as the institute's sysadmin has already tried everything he could.

Everything I tried seemed to not saturate the pipe very much and ultimately settled in on using multiple instances \`rsync\` to perform parallel transfers that seems to almost do the job.

This got me wondering: *are there competing tools with \`rsync\` that will automatically perform a parallelized / concurrent transfer for data?*

Even with this manually parallelized transfer of data there are always some variable children folders that end up having significantly more data than others and these only end up transferring at fractional speeds with \`rsync\` and thus the bandwidth saturation doesn't hold for the last hour or so of the transfer and if this weren't the case the window would be satisfied.

We correlated the events to a CredentialProvider DLL that was installed by Duo. 1 second after the DLL was registered we started to see login failures. The failures actually occurred slowly with a Kerberos pre-auth failure for each account every 7 minutes between 10:30 and 10:51 where all accounts were locked at 3 wrong attempts. Although we are not 100% certain this caused the issue, we have been unable to fine any other IOCs on the network.

My advice to everyone - log everything. And if you don't have a SIEM get one. We use Graylog and its amazing.

Hi All, 

Last night we detected abnormal lockout activity across out network. Within seconds all accounts across our network were locked out by kadmin/changepw. All events originated by a domain controller that was rebooting. All events were 4771, Kerberos Pre-Authentication failed with a result code of 0x12. 

We gained access and immediately removed our internet connections. We have no idea what happened, and it is looking more and more like a bug in AD. We checked the following things.

* SIEM logs from the firewall and from our domain controllers, nothing by legit DNS traffic.
* No abnormal scheduled tasks on any workstations or servers.  
* Cylance Protect + Optics logs, no abnormal activity. No detected executables, no new scripts ran anywhere across the network. No hits on Optics. 
* Checked OWA + Netscaler logs, nothing abnormal. We have rate limiting and a WAF in front of both as well. Everything is 2FA w/ Duo. 
* Coordinated with out firewall vendor to see if they detected any abnormal network connections - no known malicious connections. 
* Checked AD for any modifications of the Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins and other sensitive groups, none. 
* Looked for abnormal password resets, none. 
* Checked for Keberos golden ticket.

1492,t3_gcdmyc,"Hey Sysadmin folks! I am so happy to see this group exists. I could really use some advice. I'm the IT manager for a company that builds large custom machinery for automotive companies. I've been disappointed with our legacy ERP &amp; timekeeping systems since I got this job. The company is fantastic. We build and engineer everything in America- we make some of the coolest machinery out there. But we are stuck in the past.

Our machines take 6-12 months to design, and the same amount of time to build. These machines are the size of large houses in many cases. We are typically working on 3-8 of these machines at any given time. Everything is custom built to our customer's production needs, but we do keep a large stock of commonly used components.

These machines that we build have hundreds of tasks/ subassemblies, and they take such a long time to build that we haven't been able to find anything that actually works well. 

Ideally, I could create a new project only *one time* in this new- dream ERP. (As opposed to having to create and track all of the tasks/ subassemblies in 3 different programs.) The 100 or so tasks (allocated across the dozen or so subassemblies) that make up a full machine could sync with:

· Full featured project management module. Integrated Gantt charts are a must. (Schedule is very important, visibility on who is doing what over the months is critical). 

· Project based accounting. (Labor and component costs flowing into tasks.) 

· Timekeeping (Everyone from engineers to welders to logistics personell clock into the same tasks but charge different types of work to them.) 

· Resource planning (Departments/ people are allocated to taskbars within the project management interface; their commitments could be visible and the resource vould go red if it was overcommitted during a certain timeframe). 

Of course, I’m assuming the ERP would have standard modules for all other business needs. 

Other very nice to haves would be: 

* Cloud based. Maybe open source? Some options are just too expensive.
* Integration with- or inclusion of- mobile clock in app. We have many remote workers when we install these machines at customer sites. 
* Integration with- or inclusion of- invoicing / service-center module. We do a decent amount of aftermarket work for our customer base. 

I have looked at Oracle/ Netsuite a lot. It is just too expensive. Microsoft Dynamics is fairly expensive too- and really falls short on the project management side of things. Odoo maybe looks good, and all of the opensource stuff is much more affordable/ appealing, but I don’t know anything about opensource and it doesn’t seem like any of it is well suited for manufacturers who make huge always-custom things; just manufacturers who crank out the same goods over and over. Job-shop focused ERPs also seem to fall short on accommodating the length and amount of tasks and subassemblies that we produce. Meetings with Shoptech E2 &amp; JobBoss haven’t been great. 

At this point I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask here. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. Love and respect to all of you wonderful folks in IT.",In search of a good ERP for a Large Custom Machinery Builder.,r/sysadmin,0.67,2,1588481243.0,16,1

Many sysAdmins are winging some part of their job. None of us have all answers when it comes to IT, so we usually turn to the internet for a solution, an idea or some sort of inspiration.

**Here's the point:** If you figure out what was causing your issue (or at least a good workaround) before anyone replies to you - **reply to yourself**.  This will have two benefits:

1. If and when you encounter this issue again so many months down the line (let's be real, it's IT), you'll thank yourself because there's a good chance you might have forgotten how you fixed it.
2. Let's say you never need the solution again. Other sysAdmins might. We're a community just trying to do our best to keep these systems alive and sharing the knowledge is only to our advantage.

My task today was to fire it up and check it out. The instructions I was able to get out of the previous developer was to just start the EC2 server instances, create a DNS cname record to the AWS load balancers in the project instance and it should come back up and be available. That is he said if no one had done anything to it in the year this thing has been in hibernation.   

Did that and of course nothing by 503 errors for my effort. I start poking around in the windows servers, load balancers and such and there just doesn't seem to be much there. 6 lambda functions, 0 instances in RDS but it is offering to restore stuff. The servers are little guys 16GB of RAM 100GB hard drives and 4 processors.  

Now here is the kicker, the failed company paid nearly $200,000 for this project. I'm a windows sysadmin on a good day and this is my first exposure to AWS. It's really neat to gain exposure to this tech and I'll certainly learn more, but today I need somebody to look at this and tell me if there is anything here, and if so how to get it linked back together and started.  

The previous developer wants a significant amount of money, like 40 dev hours to ""get back up to speed on this project"" and he told me not to expect any additional assistance unless we engage him. Odd attitude from somebody that I'd most likely be engaging to finish it up. It was developed to be a salable SaaS product.

Our current plan is to export the VMs, then import them into the new hardware so we can turn the old ones on still if there are problems (I'm aware we can't turn the old AD server back on once it has been running on the new hardware).

The steps we've outlined are:

-Shut down VMs
-Merge any checkpoints
-Export VMs to shared drive on new hardware
-Import into new host
-Update Hyper-V services on VMs
-Boot App server and test before booting AD
-Decommission old hardware

Most things I found were either about ""transitioning from sysadmin to dev"" or ""becoming a sysadmin from scratch"" which contains a lot of ""noise"" for me (I know my way around a console).

It's entirely possible I missed something.
If that's the case please point me at it.

## My Background

I've been working as a full-stack dev for over 5 years now.
During this time I've:

- wrote new applications from scratch
- worked extensively with Docker
- setup and maintained CI pipelines (Jenkins, Travis, and CirlceCI)
- deployed into and worked with a k8s cluster
- used some Terraform to provision the occasional DB

As you might see I know the basics.
I'm comfortable working with a CLI interface.

This also means that I have a hard time finding resources with a low ""signal to noise"" ratio on learning the Linux sysadmin ropes.

## What I've considered

During my research I came across a bunch of suggestions:

- everything on the [bootcamp page of the wiki][bootcamp]
- setup a Linux box from scratch, break it and try to repair it, do it again
- work through [Linux From Scratch][linux-from-scratcH]
- get a [linuxacademy][linuxacademy] subscription

Now these are all valuable suggestions!
But with my current know-how, I have a hard time determining which of these is the best point to start.

## What I hope for from you

As a father of two small kids, I __do not__ have a lot of time on my hand.
This means I would rather like to avoid delving into the ""wrong"" thing, to not ""lose"" a lot of the little time I have.

What I hope for is some feedback on where I get the best ""return of investment"" from where I'm standing at right now.
That might be you pointing at the list above, saying ""do them in the order you listed"", or maybe it's something totally different.
One way or another, I can more confidently begin to invest the little time I have into learning.

Please point me at something and tell me ""with your current know-how you best do _this_""

## What I want to learn

While I might be comfortable working as a full-stack dev, I'm totally lost when it actually gets to setting up and maintaining the underlying machines and networks.

At the end of this I would like to feel know how to:

1. setup a bunch of Linux boxes from scratch, be they bare metal or VMs (knowing which distro to chose, what software to install etc.)
2. configure a proper and secure network between said boxes
3. monitor the boxes and troubleshoot issues
4. keep the boxes up-to-date and secure
5. automate most, if not all of this

I expect that - after I got a good grasp of points 1 to 4 - point 5 will be quite simple.
After all automating things is basically my current job description.

I do not need to learn all this on an enterprise level - although I think I'll be able to expand into this area once I check all the boxes.
For now I would like to be able to do this at home and from there move to doing the same in a cloud environment.

I expect a good test would be to setup a k8s cluster from scratch, which would most likely include all the relevant skills.

I'm prepared that getting there will take months.

### TL;DR

I'm a dev with 5 years of Docker, CI, and backend dev experience with little time (2 kids).
Which resources on learning the Linux sysadmin ropes have a low ""signal to noise"" ratio with my current background?

* There are no performance counters
* There is an event source registered (Microsoft-Windows-DeliveryOptimization) - but it's certainly not used in any way, and I cannot access it. 
* I have a group policy that tells clients to cache things for 30 days, but **Get-DeliveryOptimizationStatus** yields nothing the instant they are done transferring (i.e. Office 365 updates) Is it still caching? It says that it is during the install, but once the install is done, I see nothing.  With Office 365, I don't ever see peer sharing either, so it's using DO without any caching - blah.
* Why isn't **Get-DeliveryOptimizationLog** in an event log?  It's just a mismatch of unstructured text, pseudo-json; completely unorganized, not too friendly to query.
* **Get-DeliveryOptimizationPerfSnapThisMonth** seems to be the most useful, but it's a fixed cmdlet with no way of modifying parameters of any kind.

I have a reseller account with a very important product that my customers purchase from me. The way it works is that I have a ""master"" reseller account and they have individual customer accounts. That way a customer can login and see their account status, pay their bill, etc.

One of my customers just had one of their employees resign (let's call her Stephanie). Stephanie was the one that paid that bill every month. Stephanie's replacement contacted me today asking how to get access to the portal so they could take over Stephanie's duties.

No problem. Login to reseller portal, change the contact information for the customer including the email address, and click the ""customer forgot password"" button in the reseller portal which sends them a link to change their password.

Or so I thought.

Stephanie's replacement forwarded me the email they got asking if it was legit. Good job. Always appreciate that especially if you're new and a random email is asking for you to click a link and set a password.

1537,t3_gbjh2v,"I'm a DBA at a huge fortune 100 company. I support dozens of applications from different teams across the company and my work is a mix of issue support and helping implement new code/fixes to the it. Until recently my time tracking was simple. Company meetings were one bucket, Dev support is another, Prod support another, and then PTO.  It had been this way for years.

However recently our new parent company is pushing a standard for time tracking that makes no sense to me. Their standard is that a minimum of 50% of our weekly time needs to be charged to ""projects"" and not the dev or prod support. They've point blank said that if our team is not meeting this standard within a few months, we can expect a reduction in workforce because through their eyes it means we have too many employees. Whatever, seems reasonable, except:

\- Exec management have not communicated this to any of the application teams we support and won't be doing that. Not the exec that handles the development and systems departments, or our systems department to the application departments. It is our individual job as DBAs to let each customer we work with know that they now need to allocate budgeting, have a project manager go in and give me the ability to charge time against the project, argue with the PM about hours it took every week, and help them understand what a project is compared to baseline support. There is a doc only within our department about this, but we are not the same department as the many different application teams across the company.

\- Most of my customers don't even have a PM, project time/hours/ids in our system, or even the ability to use our time tracking system to allocate these hours to me to charge against. This past week for example, I must have spent at least 4 hours in meetings, emails, etc with just a single internal support customer trying to figure out how they can set up a project for me to charge time against, and the only answer I've gotten from anyone is ""oh we can't do that"". And it's only my problem, so no one else is following up.

\- Most of the customers are also not used to doing any of this for support. It has already been a struggle getting any of them to use our ticketing system instead of email or IMs. So far I've received confusion and anger from people who are mad because ""they never used to have to do any of this before"" and ""it sounds like a lot of paperwork.""

\- Management is not enforcing that we stop work for any teams that don't or can't do project hours. The teams don't care that I'm not able to charge project time, just that I keep working for them. My manager basically is just shrugging it off or saying ""yeah it's really annoying I wish they gave us better guidelines."" Ok great, well...

\- Some weeks there is just going to be a ton of support issues, and they don't at least on paper want us to track more than 40 hours a week. I've had weeks where I've done a full work week just handling people's issues. It sounds like I'm supposed to make up projects that don't even exist.

\- They are very vague about what a project is. For example if we help a customer having time out issues in their database and can easily identify an index that would help them, that is production support. If it ends up needing a deeper dive into their code that takes hours to debug stored procs and test, that becomes a project. It is up to me to randomly decide when it has crossed into ""project"" territory and start asking for project hours. I can just see that going great, explaining to a customer that their issue is suddenly a project that costs their department money when they are used to just getting all of my time for free, or when I did the same thing but in less time (because it was less complex or I was just awesome that week) it was baseline but now this new thing is a project.

\- It is now going to be an extra few hours a week just trying to keep track of this project stuff between tracking my hours, arguing with PMs or applications who don't consider something a project or the hours I want to charge, etc, for what is not a project based role (for example we still have on-call rotation and the expectation that all support work is prioritized over project work in terms of when it is done). And I am already very busy and not able to work in my own internal DBA projects as much as I'd like.

Is this the norm in corporate internal IT or am I missing something? I just want a job where I can show up, do my work, fill out a basic timesheet and get paid for my work. Not one where I have to explain to dozens of apathetic or cranky developers and business people they have to do paperwork and set things up for me to charge time against. Or be worried that me or someone on my team will be let go because I couldn't do anything when one of my customers says ""we don't have project hours.""

This is a problem with computer object's AD security group changes not processing at the client.

I am working with preparing Windows 10 1909.  I have a number of GPOs configured that use security group filtering to apply/deny.  I am pretty sure that there is no problem with the security filter based on the fix I found later and I am sure the problem is not AD replication issues.

When I add/remove a computer to/from an AD group and reboot, the computer is not processing that group memebership change correctly.  I noticed this because GPOs assigned to the newly added group were not being applied.  I ran GPResult and could see in the computer section's  security group information, that the computer was holding on to the *old* group memerships - even after an hour had passed and the computer was rebooted several times.  I thought at first maybe there was an AD replication problem but opening ADUC pointing to different DC, they all had the correct intformation.

But still GPResult was displaying old group memberships from earlier in the day.

Now, that is not a good situation.  We add computers to groups all the time to configure them in certain ways.  I cant have a case where making an AD group change doesn't take place immediately at  reboot.  Something.  Basically the idea was to open a system command window and delete/expire all the system's Kerberos tokens.  That did correct the problem.  This is why I don't suspect a problem with AD replication or a problem with the GPO security filters.  As soon as I flushed the Kerberos tickets, the client recomputed its group memberships and GPResult showed the correct information.  

Is there a setting in Windows 10 now that tells computers not to cache AD group memberships over a reboot?  Is this a new something in Win 10 1909 ?

I know this question has been asked a ton, but most of the threads are &gt;7months old so thought I'd ask in case anything has changed.

Basically our situation is:

* We're a young company (&lt;10 employees) and plan to scale to \~20 in the next year or so.
* None of us have a background in IT, and we likely won't have someone with that back ground for at least 2 years.
* We're mostly BYOD, but we're going to start distributing Macbook Airs to employees who ask for one. It'll likely be 1 -3 computers over the next few months, and maybe 10 a year from now.
* To start, we're just going to use an MDM with company computers. Eventually we'll want to get all the BYOD devices (including phones) into our system as well, but that's likely well over a year from now now. 100% of company provided computers will be macs, but I imagine a few BYODs will be PCs (although it'll be a very small amount)
* I want to 80/20 security as much as possible. Employees access sensitive customer information via our CRM, but nothing is saved locally. My best guess for how we manage that is by:
   * Requiring devices to have a firmware + user login password that's complex
   * Encryption turned on
   * Maybe, something like Malware Bytes
   * Password manager and unique logins for everything (not related to MDM)
* Beyond that, I don't have the bandwidth to deal with requests from users — if someone wants to download Spotify they can and I don't care. A best case scenario is this is something I can set and forget.

Are there any strong recommendations for an MDM based on the above? Apple recommended Jamfnow and Mosyle, and I independently came across Fleetsmith — although Apple recommended against them.

Jamfnow is confusing and there's no demo, so I disregarded it, and Mosyle seems adequate. That said, Fleetsmith seemed great — it appears to just work and is intuitive (much like Apple products). Of everything, it appears that I could set and forget Fleetsmith the best, but I'm worried since (1) I don't see much about them on here and (2) Apple actually recommended against them.

I'm also worried Fleetsmith is a great choice for right now, but maybe will present a headache as we scale and need to change systems (but with no experience I don't know how much to value this worry).

The problem is I am working on a migration that has me moving users into a new OU. When they're moved to the new OU they can no longer successfully auth to DW using their domain credentials. If I move them back it works fine. Some info:

- Brand new accounts created in the new OU have the same issue, if moved to the old one they're fine
- the BIND is looking for a SG membership, this SG remains in the same OU it has always been and that is not the same as the original OU I am moving users from either so nothing changes with this SG
- Import is successful, always
- Removing from DW and reimporting making no difference
- Resetting the password for the user's domain account does not resolve it
- We have a cameraaccessonly OU that was created when we set this up, its for outside access. These users are fine too.
- The issue seems to be with the OU that was created after the camera system was set up
- bind is not searching any specific OU except the default users which is where the SG for membership sits

So for some reason users can only auth if their in the original OU, but for all intents and purposes it shouldnt matter. Nothing looks directly at that old OU, its looking for group memership and the group is not being moved.

With this whole Coronavirus thing happening, we are looking to replace our teacher workstations and Chromebooks with a Windows laptop that they can carry back and forth. We have roughly a $1000 budget per teacher with the device and dock included.

We were looking at third party docks that had VGA or HDMI support on them, along with a 3.5mm jack to interface with our projectors and sound systems in each classroom.

We were looking for touchscreen laptops that could ideally function as a tablet as well at about $800. I wanted to look around before talking to any reps and getting their prices and the first generation Microsoft Surface keeps coming up in my searches.

Have any of you had experience with these devices? The ones I was looking at have 7th Gen i5s (or maybe i7s, I can't remember), 8 Gigs of RAM, and 256 Gig SSDs. Anyone else have any other suggestions that I could look into that could be purchased in bulk. I estimate we will need ~100-150 of these devices.

1. Client is having no Proxy settings prior to VPN connection 
2. Client connects to the VPN
3. Proxy is automatically set to script by the anyconnect client and the connection tab in the Internet explorer options is being disabled 
4. Client gets the Internet Explorer GPO Settings from the Domain Controller within the regular schedule of gpo processing which is every 90 min
5. Domain GPO overrides (clears)the ASA Proxy changes though VPN connection still remains
6. Client loses connection to targeted internal sources due to the required proxy settings for the vpn connection.

How can I avoid the ASA settings getting overwritten or block the policy changes to the clients.

My latest problem is that some of my users like to customise their quick access, task bar pinned items, excel/outlook options etc very heavily, but the settings they change don't apply to all the hosts.  
I haven't had any experience with UPD or UE-V (as I've only ever had one host to work with) but it sounds like they would work to fix that problem.  

To complicate things, we have folder redirection turned on for my documents, downloads, desktop to a file server but some users have appdata redirected, and some don't.  

I'm hoping for the users that DON'T have appdata redirection turned on, I can use UPD or UE-V so they can change settings and their appdata is saved to the central location and, for example, each host would have the same quick access stuff pinned. It wouldn't effect their normal workstation, all appdata changes would be contained in the RDS environment, and the folder redirection for Downloads/Desktop to the file server would work as normal.  

My concern is that for the people who DO have appdata redirected is that the changes they make to Windows and appdata on the RDS environment will mess around with their normal workstations, and UPD or UE-V wouldn't really stop that from happening.  

So I guess my question is, can I stop appdata redirection from applying to the new RDS environment, so it just uses an appdata folder than is on the UPD or UE-V and keeps settings away from their workstation.

*Edit: Been doing some testing. Registry edit doesn't work on 1909. There is a better way, use secpol.msc*

In the absence of a VPN connection, when using some sort of remote assistance desktop sharing to administer the PC of WFH user you may encounter the problem of not being able to see a UAC for admin tasks.

This is because UAC normally appears on a separate secure desktop. You can force the UAC on to the user's desktop where you can see it by using secpol.msc to set 
Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation to Disabled.

~~following registry value:~~

~~HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System REG-DWORD EnableUIADesktopToggle = 1~~

~~But you cannot use Regedit to set the value even from the elevated command prompt because, you guessed it, UAC.~~


But you cannot use secpol.msc to set the value even from the elevated command prompt because, you guessed it, UAC. 

Now you don't want to give you user *your* admin credentials to enter into UAC, so here is a workaround:

Start elevated command prompt with RunAS

    c:\&gt;runas /user:example\user.name cmd.exe

In the elevated command prompt open local user manager

    c:\&gt;lusrmgr.msc. 

In local user manager create a throwaway temp user with a simple password and add to administrators group. Leave local user manager open.

Start Secpol

    c:\&gt;secpol.msc 

Get user to use the newly made temp user credentials in UAC for Secpol.

Set Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation to Disabled.

~~Start regedit~~

~~c:\&gt;regedit.msc~~ 

~~Get user to use the newly made temp user credentials in UAC for regedit.~~

~~Edit the EnableUIADesktopToggle value as above.~~

When done go back to local user manager and delete the throwaway admin account.

You will now have a UAC that you can see over your remote assistance tool.

____________________________________________________________________

Edit to add:

Some people are saying this or that tool avoids the problem. That is all well and good if the tool is/was available and that necessary work was was done ahead of time.

We've been using Datto/Backupify to backup Office 365, but I'm really unhappy with it: its interface is clunky at best, no API, reports are next to worthless, etc.

I'm trying to get, in any form, the offline files cache limit (maximum amount of space offline files can use on a Windows computer) programmatically, when the limit is not assigned by Group Policy.

The easiest way that the data can be accessed is by going to Control Panel &gt; Sync Center &gt; Manage Offline Files &gt; Disk Usage. The information I'm looking for is the space available, in use, and/or limit, for ""All Offline Files."" If I can get two of these values I can calculate the third. However, the information here is only provided visually, and I can't figure out where it's sourced from.

From what I've found, there's a registry entry when the limit is assigned by group policy, but we don't set the limit through  group policy.

I know incorporating so many different pieces of hardware in one setup like this can cause massive headaches with setup and sometimes lead to compatibility issues, but I'm not entirely sure what my alternative is. From what I found online, my options were either a dual display DP switch, a quad display DP switch that supports up to four systems, or a triple display DP to HDMI switch. Everything I've read has indicated that using an MST to split one of the signals from the KVM switch shouldn't cause any issues.

I found two solid options while looking around on reddit and other sites ([ATEN CS1942DP](https://www.aten.com/us/en/products/kvm/desktop-kvm-switches/cs1942dp/) and [StarTech SV231DPDDUA2](https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/2-port-dual-dp-kvm-switch~SV231DPDDUA2)), but reading reviews online, they both seem to have issues with either audio passthrough or transmitting the full bandwidth required for 1440p 144hz. These are both dealbreakers for me, unfortunately. I was also pointed towards the [Level1 DP 1.4 Dual Monitor KVM Switch](https://store.level1techs.com/products/kvm-switch-2-port-dual-monitor-8k-model). This one looks the most promising, but I just want to make sure there are no other options out there that have integrated EDID feeding (the Level1 does not). I know KVM switches are typically unreliable and difficult to set up properly, but I'm hoping someone here might be using one that they've found to work well.

Originally we were using a persistent actual vmdk disk on this vm and that was fine, but we had to make some changes and now the actual data contents are on another vm.  It has to stay like this.

So, the goal is that we need to map a drive letter on the original VM and this drive is just a file share off the second vm.  So on original VM it would ""always"" see the J drive for example no matter who is logged on or whether someone even is logged on.  

Any thoughts on how to do this?  I tried mapping a drive via command line with ""/persistent:yes"" and it maps but I haven't looked if that shows up when other users sign in, or whether their app would actually be able to use it.  I'm just suspecting it would not show up and work correctly.  

Secondly, I tried to put that same command into a ""scheduled task"" and have it trigger on vm startup, but that same command fails to map the drive.  Is that because the task itself runs as a domain user and the map drive command has its own user/password listed in it?  (the drive is off another vm in another domain, so we have to pass creds when we map it.  it works fine as just a command line command)

Been thrown in the deep end here. I have a Dell PowerEdge T420 tower server that has given a predictive failure on a 600GB 10K SAS drive. The server has four 600GB SAS drives in RAID10 and one 2TB SATA drive that isn't in a RAID array. There are free slots for additional drives.

I've ordered a new 600GB SAS drive from Dell but the wait time is between 30 - 60 days! In the meantime, I have purchased an identical 'refurbished' 600GB SAS from a seller on eBay. Can anyone explain the process to replace the predicted fail drive with the refurbished SAS drive? Is it a matter of pull the old drive out, plug the new drive in while the server is being used?

I'm looking into ways of automating Windows Server patching, and not just the actual patch installation and rebooting. I would like to find a good orchestration/automation tool that would allow us to set up specific rules about which hosts to patch first, and also allow us to set up a series of checks after patching is done. 

For instance, our Lync pool would need to only be patched one server at a time, and between patching and rebooting of each server, a check would need to verify that the fabric health is OK. Once all servers are done patching a final check on the fabric health would be needed as well.

We have hundreds of servers and a relatively small outage window, so automating as much as possible makes sense to me. We use SCCM, I am working on implementing ADRs and phased deployments. However from what I've seen so far, SCCM does not have the ability to perform predefined health checks as part of the update process.

Recently, things have been tense with this client because they're refusing to pay me the rate they had agreed to. I don't want to cause any further issues with them while I sort out the payment issue, so I'm planning on downloading the software.

HOWEVER, I find it a complete invasion of my privacy that they want to log my keystrokes and take screenshots while I'm tracking time. **Is there a way to block the desktop Hubstaff app from doing this? Or possibly remove those permissions? I'm using a 2013 MacBook Pro running macOS Catalina.** 

They've specifically requested that I use the desktop app because the browser and iOS versions don't take screenshots. My top concern at the moment is that I don't want them to be able see rough drafts of the emails I'm sending them because, like I said, things are a little tense.

I also believe employee monitoring software is unethical. When I'm working on projects (I'm a graphic designer &amp; animator), I spend time away from my computer just thinking, or sometimes sketching out ideas, but still using brain power dedicated toward my project. Something like Hubstaff would flag this as an inactive period. This is just one reason, among many, that I would prefer to not use the software. However, if I bring these issues up with my client I'm worried that they'll drop my services and not pay me the money that they currently owe me.

EDIT:
For anyone else who’s facing this problem: it looks like there’s no real technical solution. A VM might work if you know how to set one up correctly, but from my understanding there’s a lot of potential for that to go wrong. 

After some extra research, the best solution I could find was to inform my client that by using employee monitoring software I would be putting my other clients’ information at risk. If the software took a screenshot of another client’s internal files or company information I could potentially breach my NDA. I then informed them that I’d be willing to use the software if they sent me a separate work computer - which I really doubt they’ll want to go through with (thanks for the suggestion). 

This isn’t a perfect solution either but at least it gives me an arguably better reason why I’m refusing to use the software.

1707,t3_gaz622,"Hello! I am a beginner sysadmin with limited (mostly Linux and FreeBSD) experience. I have been working with a client that has a small office, \~10 people with an upcoming expansion to a total maximum of 20.

&amp;#x200B;

We have redone and reconfigured their network and have put a pfSense router, a FreeNAS server and an XCP-NG hypervisor in place.

&amp;#x200B;

The client is really keen on not losing data and not having downtime. He is willing to spend a bit more for the sake of everything being safe and working correctly and is quite tech-savvy so he is really nice to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

His employees are using regular Windows 10 workstations, mainly for: 

1. the Office Suite 
2. A proprietary business CRM-like software that is hosted on a Server 2016 machine (that will be converted to a VM soon) and has a Windows 10 client program 
3. Web browsers

&amp;#x200B;

Since the employees are not really keen on backing up their stuff to the FreeNAS server or the cloud (Dropbox), we have been looking for a solution to make sure no data is lost and no downtime occurs due to workstation hardware failures (which would most commonly be a drive failure).

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been thinking of repurposing the current and future workstations as thin clients, possibly with the implementation of an AD DC and automatic mapping of all the usual Windows directories to FreeNAS SMB shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, going with a server-side based solution would allow us to use used thin clients, raspberry pis or something else that is low cost and low power for the upcoming office expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to keep to FOSS as much as possible, mainly due to cost.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have been thinking about:

Boot the clients to openthinclient or thinstation from the network and use RDP or Spice, depending on what we will go for.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario A:

Build a sort-of VDI solution, based on either XCP-NG or Proxmox with VM storage on FreeNAS. Going with KVM could open the path to using Ravada VDI or something similar for a FOS VDI broker, use spice, or implement hardware GPU acceleration with the help of an AMD S7150X2 since it supports SR-IOV on Linux. We only really need a base image and VM clones and we would probably tie it to a Windows or Samba AD DC or other solutions such as Zentyal. We would probably need to buy a dual or quad Sandy or Ivy Bridge used CPU server.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario B:

Deploy Windows RDS from a Windows 2019 server, either physical or virtual. Problem is, I have no idea how Windows RDS works, if I can use Linux clients for it, what kind of limitations it has and what kind of hardware + licensing I would need.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Does Spice suck?
2. Does RDP suck?
3. Would you go through the hassle of implementing HW graphics acceleration and for what reason? (VDI scenario)
4. I absolutely need low-level USB redirection. AFAIK that means I need to either use spice or RemoteFX. Does RemoteFX even work with hypervisors other than Hyper-V and clients other than Windows?
5. Would you go for A or B and why? Is it too much hassle?
6. What kind of problems can you identify in my way of thinking? Am I missing something or have misunderstood something?

1712,t3_gay1jz,"Good day fellow admins! Several months ago, I stood up an Enterprise CA in our org and I will admit my experience within the realm of CA is pretty limited. We are using a self-signed cert, not a public trusted SSL cert. That being said, since setting up the CA, we're still getting the 'Your connection is not private' warning when visiting websites that reside within our domain/intra-net. Is there a fix for this without purchasing a Trusted SSL Cert from a provider? What I have verified:

1.) The CA Cert is being pushed to the devices in question

2.) Our domain CA is in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities section for the assets in question

3.) The assets in question have personal certs issued (not expired) from the CA

I feel as though there might have been some kind of setting/configuration I may have missed when creating the initial cert to begin with as my understanding is that any domain asset should still be trusted by virtue of the domain CA being a trusted root ca. Thank you in advance for your insight as I've already done extensive googling and banging of my head against the wall on this issue so far. I do appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Following u/OhioIT's advice, I was able to get the issue resolved. See below:

I was getting a ' NET::ERR\_CERT\_COMMON\_NAME\_INVALID' error due to the incorrect configuration of the cert applied to the web server. This was because the cert being used didn't have the appropriate 'Subject Alternative Name' (SAN) entries. So how did I fix it?

1. On the CA server, I cloned the Web Server Template and adjusted the compatibility to the oldest server/workstations in our environment (2012/Windows 8.1) and on the Cryptography tab, I selected 'Requests can use any provider available on the subject's computer'. In the security tab, I added the two servers that would be using the cert with read/write/enroll permissions enabled and saved it.
2. Also on the CA server, I issued that template within certsrv
3. On the IIS servers, I opened MMC and under the Personal/Certificates, I requested a new certificate. I selected the new web server cert.
4. **(IMPORTANT)** For the uninitiated, make sure you check the following:
   1. 'Subject Name:Type' was set to 'Common Name' and I entered '[server.contoso.com](https://server.contoso.com)' and added it.
   2. 'Alternative name: Type:' was set to DNS and I entered just the dns name without the domain attached (example: server, not [server.contoso.com](https://server.contoso.com)) and added it.
   3. 'Alternative name: Type:' was then set to IP which auto filled the server's IP address and added it
   4. 'Alternative name: Type:' was finally set to URL and I added the URL's that would be used by the websites and added. 
   5. on the General tab, I added the friendly name and description for ease of finding the cert when applying it in IIS.
   6. Then I finished enrolling the cert and it was then available for IIS to use.
5. In IIS (Internet Information Services Manager) I selected the Default Web Site under the ServerName/Sites/ folder and selected Bindings -&gt; 443 -&gt; and selected the appropriate server which was easy using the descriptors i set in the steps above. 
6. Then I restarted the website and blammo: Cert works!

Up until a couple of days ago, things were printing fine, now all of a sudden we are unable to print anything. Documents will briefly spool and then disappear from the queue. If a printer is set to keep printed documents in the queue they will show as printed instantly after they finish spooling no matter how many pages are supposedly printed (I've tried upwards of 1600 pages).

Here's the troubleshooting I've tried so far:

* Ensured Print Server has the latest Windows Update
* Uninstalled the most recent non-security updates since problems started (and shortly before)
* Restarted Server
* Restarted Print Spooler service, both using the restart option and simply stopping and starting it
* Ensured printers print on their own; both configuration pages and USB direct connect
* Tried printing from Multiple computers, including the print server itself
* Shut down print spooler and cleared everything out of System32\\spool\\PRINTERS
* For one of our multi-purpose printers I:
   * Created a new printer and port to it's IP address
   * Tried literally ever latest Windows 10 Driver available on the manufacturer's site
   * Tried every Print Processor
   * Unchecked ""Render print jobs on client computers""
   * Unchecked ""SNMP Status Enabled"" in the port configuration
   * Set it to print only after all pages are spooled
   * Unchecked ""Print spooled documents first""
   * Checked ""Hold mismatched documents""
   * Set a new IP Address

The only major change since this problem arose was a change to the permissions, but as far as I can tell the permissions are set up correctly and this doesn't sound like a permissions issue because there's no permissions errors and documents are spooling correctly.

Any new suggestions are welcome because I've run out of ideas and at this point we are considering just rebuilding the thing on physical hardware to see if Hyper-V is causing the issue.  


EDIT:

Figured out the problem. Turns out it was a permissions issue. We had removed the Everyone group from the Print Server Properties ACL while setting up our new groups in there. The problem is that the Service group isn't included in the ACL by default meaning that while everyone had permission to print, and were able to spool documents correctly, the print spooler service itself didn't have permission to print. 

After giving the Service group permission to print we were good to go.

These directors also own their own devices, and only some of them have and use our corp email because they have their own thing going. Think the rich, globe trotting type.

Now it has always been a challenge with these guys n gals. They don't pay much mind to the tech side of things, yet still expects to have communication benefits. And of course, the department's still fully responsible for them being able to communicate well. To add to this, some use Apples. 

So the scenario is this:  As some of you would know, MS offered 6 months O365 E1 for free to help with comms during the current pandemic. We took this offer to be able to use Teams and is in the middle of deployment.

Adrian, one of the directors, responds to our initial emails, saying he logged in, changed his password, installed Teams on his Mac, and now it's stuck on initializing. He asked what could be the problem and what could he do to progress.

Brent responded to the email with ""F*ck knows..""

My wife was home yesterday and we share a big desk. She said she saw me turn white.

I immediately called Brent and while asking him what the hell, the managing director calls me to ask what the hell. Adrian forwarded the email to him.

The managing director was furious. He said he was calling HR after, and prepare to start the protocol to change admin passwords, Brent was out.

I called Adrian after, apologizing profusely for the response he got, and telling him I'm putting someone else from support on it for him. His response was ""What was he drinking?"".

Said next time he's in the country for a personal board meeting he'll take him out for some Jack.

For example.  Have HRLIST list and DOCLIBLIST document library list.  A new item in HRLIST will copy document in DOCLIBLIST and append names from HRLIST.  The issue is if one list changes, the other is compromised and may not correct itself.  For instance, HR can't spell...because they f\*\*\*ing cannot.  They correct the first name.

I run a medium sized engineering business and have been bitten hard by IT “companies” in the past. I now do all of my own IT and it takes up pretty much most of my week. 

I’ve been charged astronomical rates by “professional IT” companies who I feel like are hijacking my credentials and locking me into service contracts and undertaking IT tasks that I can do in half the time myself. 

Our IT systems are, I guess, a little more complex than usual (but I don’t know for sure). Windows servers for distributed file systems across multiple sites, license servers for engineering softwares, multiple VPN’s for redundancy for offsite workers (COVID-19 forced but working well now), in house development and stage servers for Software engineering teams, AWS for production servers, 30odd workstation PCs and laptops, security systems, and probably more. 

I would love to hire someone to do the job, but feel it isn’t really a full time job, although it may actually be!?! And definitely cannot justify exorbitant “IT consulting” costs, for something I could do myself out of hours and have a few thousand dollars per day more in my pocket instead of giving to “IT company”.

Created a patch cable to access the management ipv4 port. After, MDSS was able to see the array and I could manage it through MDSM and create virtual disks, etc.
Unplugged and using in-band mgmt now.

Now I just need to find a battery for controller 1 to replace since there was a warning it was missing on the RAID controller in MDSM. No bueno.

======================

First off, I'm a complete noob with SAN/NAS/Storage arrays so apologize in advance.  I've [RTFM](http://downloads.dell.com/Manuals/Common/powervault-md3200_Deployment%20Guide_en-us.pdf), (not sure I fully understand it, but I've read it) and searched all over the Internet for help and clues.  Inherited a ""project"" and am not a storage guy, but since I am the only person on the team that is somewhat proficient with \*nix I got stuck with it.

Setup (from what I can tell):

R720 with (2) LSI PCI-e SAS cards

    03:00.0 RAID bus controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic MegaRAID SAS 2208 [Thunderbolt] (rev 05)
    06:00.0 Serial Attached SCSI controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS2008 PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS-2 [Falcon] (rev 03)

Powervault MD3220:

SAS cable connected from array RAID controller 0 to R720 HBA card 1 and controller 1 to HBA card 2. (I don't know if this cabling is right but when I powered on the MD3220 the light finally went blue instead of flashing orange)

Nothing else plugged into MD3220, *management port is not being used*.  No other host will have access to the storage array.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've done so far:

Re-imaged the OS, using the PERC raid and local drives to the R720 for storage.   Installed Dell MCCS and ran it, during auto discovery it says *no arrays were found*.

Q1) Is the management port (192.168.128.101) **absolutely** required for direct attached? My understanding was that you could have it use In-band management...

Q2) Do I have to assign IP addresses to the SAS ports?  And if yes, how, what iface are they?

I can see the MD32xx in the /proc/scsi/scsi so I'm not sure what else I need to do for the MCCS to see the array so I can create and format partitions that the OS can see and use.

I DON'T understand the difference between the p7b (bundle file), DER, PKCS7/12, etc.

I currently don't have access to the original CSR. I have a wildcard p7b. I don't know how to extract the information that this Cisco ASA needs. I'm using ADSM to install the identity certificate. I installed the root and intermediary certificates.

I've been using OpenSSL and Google to try to grab whatever files... I don't even know if that's what ADSM is asking for. I grabbed a private key file and a certificate file, but neither work. Apparently, whatever I grabbed does not work for ADSM.

1783,t3_gadeo8,"Update below.

I'm trying to get rid of some phantom proxy server settings on multiple Win10 computers. We do have a proxy server, but are trying to decommission it. However, multiple computers keep connecting to it and I can not find what is pointing them there.

There doesn't seem to be a proxy set, but a packet capture clearly shows traffic being sent to our old proxy server by Outlook and IE (and Chrome). If I disable proxy auto detect, things work normally, but if I re-enable it, traffic again goes to the proxy.

What I've tried:

1. Check if wpad and wpad.&lt;domain&gt; are resolvable. They are not.
2. Check both DHCP servers to see if they are handing out proxy autoconfig urls. They are not.

At this point, there should be no proxy auto-config, but it is still occurring. So I dug deeper:

1. Win 10 -&gt; Settings -&gt; search for Proxy -&gt; Proxy  Settings. The only thing on is automatically detect.
2. Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options -&gt;  Connections -&gt; Lan Settings. The only thing on is automatically detect.
3. Went through every GPO looking for a proxy being set. Nothing.
4. Searched the computer's registry for the port the computer is using to talk to the proxy. Nothing with the proxy server's name or address.
5. Looked at the start up scripts. I did find one that sets HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Connections\\DefaultConnectionSettings which could contain proxy server settings hex encoded. However, commenting that out in the script, removing the setting from the computer and rebooting did nothing. It also was almost all 00, so it is unlikely that was doing it.
6. Checked C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\Custom\\ and C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Internet Explorer\\Custom\\ for possible custom file (which can be created from the IEAK). Nothing.
7. Checked \`netsh winhttp show proxy\`. No proxy set.
8. Did a complete reset of IE, hoping it was a case of a correct setting that was actually wrong. No change.
9. Attempted to disable the proxy via powershell reg edit: \`set-itemproperty 'HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings' -name ProxyEnable -value 0\`. No change.

Any ideas?

**Update:** Searching through the computer's registry, I came across a key WpadDetectedURL with an old auto proxy config file. I say old because I deleted it myself. But lacking any other ideas, I tried the url in Edge. It let me download the file!

So I went back and checked the server it was originally hosted on. Yes, it is gone. In fact, the webserver itself is turned off. A tcp-ping confirmed that. Maybe, since the proxy is still on, the proxy was serving up a cached copy of it? So I reset the proxy's cache and I cleared Edge's cache. But I could still download the file.

So I cleared Edge's cache again and ran tshark. Then I proceeded to successfully download the file again. Looking at the packet capture, I can NOT find any get request for it nor that file name in any of the packets (download is http, not https). Wireshark's export http objects doesn't show it either. So I was able to download a file without downloading it??? WTF!?!? (Yes, I captured on the correct interface. There were other objects I captured from other tabs in Edge mandated by corporate policy.)

As a sanity check, I attempted to repeat the download \[via Edge\] on a computer that is not having the problem. The download failed as it should have.

**Update 2:** Resolved (not solved). I deleted the key WpadDetectedURL, and changed the keys WpadDecision to 0 and WpadDecisionReason to 1 under the same parent. Rebooted and machine is working fine. I did find there was more than one WpadDetectedURL, so you may have to do this more than once. The keys were under HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Wpad\\&lt;some guid&gt;\\

It seems like the only meaningful limitations of M365 BP compared to O365 E3 are a 300 license max, reduced mailbox and onedrive storage, as well as limited DLP, eDiscovery, and in-place hold features. Otherwise, M365 BP has ATP P1, full Azure P1 is rolling out, and because we're a nonprofit, comes in at half the cost of O365 E3 with those add-ons.

Right now our AD is all on-prem. We'll use Azure AD Connect to sync the two directories, and once 365 is off the ground, introduce Duo to work with Azure for MFA &amp; SSO.

We use GPO to redirect the users Documents and Desktop folders to their network home directory and Offline files to sync that directory to the user's local laptop.  Both of these policies were created prior to my starting at my company and prior to the work from home situation, they have always ""just worked.""

Now what is happening is when a user is working from off network, their desktop icons get a grey X in the corner of them indicating that the offline file is unavailable when they could have been perfectly fine the day before also working remotely.  If we go to the Sync Center the status will say Sync Pending but never do anything, even when reconnected to VPN.

Back when I had direct access to the system I disabled the Offline Files GPO and when connected to the network the desktop icons worked just fine.  Reconnecting the GPO would make the files break again when the laptop was taken off of the network.  I set the registry key that would ""reset"" the Offline Files database/index, with the same results.  The only thing that I found that would reliably fix the issue was to delete the user's profile, recreate it, reactivate Offline Files and wait for it to resync.  The problem is that we need the user to bring their laptop to site for us to fix this, and this particular user has had this done 3 times now in the last month.  The user's personal directory that gets synced is over 50GB due to their inability to delete photos that they keep saving, which I suspect the size plays a factor in the problem they are experiencing.

Access to their work systems has been realized through RDP but the telephone solution we've create (more or less on the fly) is still lacking.

For the moment we forward their work extensions to their (personal) mobile phones via Single Number Reach.

At their office they use a Cisco Callmanager and (mostly) Cisco 7821 phone with a headset attached to the phone.

Before the Covid-19 crisis they have been testing with a softphone configuration (via Cisco Jabber) which worked well enough at their office, but due to the big difference in quality available PCs and laptops which are mostly personal and not company issued they don't see softphones being a good solution.

This leaves a hardware solution in which they could plug their deskphones into. Such a solution would have to overcome a few key issues:

* great variety in internet connections
* mostly no fixed IP addresses
* most users don't have any cabling but just work via WiFi from their kitchen table
* some kind of VPN is needed, exposing a Cisco Callmanager to the internet is akin to suicide

So I have come to the conclusion that I need a magic box that can do/must have:

* OpenVPN client
* Function as WiFi client/bridge
* PoE to power the phone (not a show-stopper if not)

And I'd need approx. 40 of them, so availability is also an issue. Oh, and of course it needs to be 'budget friendly' (whatever that means).

Our current WSUS is setup on Server 2012R2 and we have no known issues pushing updates to 2008R2, 2012R2, or 2016. I am seeing some odd issues getting updates to Server 2019. In testing today I setup a new 2019 server and at first received no updates as the server was not in the proper WSUS group, adjusted the group and successfully installed 7 updates; however, the server is not up-to-date with the most recent windows updates. I check for updates on the client and it says no updates are available, I look in WSUS and it shows 7 updates are set for ""install"" with a status of ""not installed"". Get-WindowsUpdateLog provides me with no errors. This is true for a couple other 2019 servers in our environment as well.

1831,t3_gfzbj2,"So here's my weird situation,

I have a handful of remote computers in my network, that when I try to ping, I get destination unreachable. If I try to do nslookup, it returns an IP address that isn't even in my IP space (the first octet of the returned IP is correct, but the second is way out of bounds). I do know that it has a good IP, these tools just think it has a different IP for some reason. I also can't RDP the system through hostname or IP either, nor can I get powershell to do anything to them remotely (enter-pssession, any command with ""-computername"" parameter, etc all fail to connect, but I can remote powershell normally to systems that don't have this issue).

If I physically go to the remote computer, and do an ipconfig on it, I see it's REAL IP, and there are no connectivity issues. I can also remote back to a server successfully, ping a server, browse the web, etc. The users of these problem computers haven't noticed anything and aren't complaining, but this has probably been an issue for quite some time.

I need to get this fixed because although the users are able to do everything they need to do, this DNS issue seems to be what's causing these systems to also not be getting their security updates correctly and it's showing on our vulnerability scans.

I feel like it's gotta be something DNS related, but because (seemingly) the hostname resolves to the incorrect IP, I can't do ipconfig /flushdns or /release &amp; /renew, etc. without physically going to each one of these systems and doing it manually.

It's gonna be a huge hassle if I have to track down each one of these manually - does anyone know of a way that I could remotely flushdns or something that I could just try? Everything on Google is saying ""It's easy! just invoke-command -script {ipconfig /flushdns} -computername 'cpname'"" 

But the -computername parameter for any powershell command fails on these computers, probably because it's resolving to the wrong IP.

This has been driving me nuts for a while now. Hopefully I'm just doing something dumb and someone can point it out. I greatly appreciate any suggestions.",Help with a remote IP/DNS/Windows issue?,r/sysadmin,1.0,1,1588993480.0,0,1

If i run MS-Settings: it opens fin and it seems to fix the issue (I can then run settings from the start menu fine.) However, its only for the user that i run that on so the next user will be unable to run settings.
