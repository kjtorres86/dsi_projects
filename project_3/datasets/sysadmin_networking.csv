I've got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.  

I've built a bunch of tunnels Cisco &gt; Sonicwall where both sides have public IPs.  So many that it's beyond routine - I have a template.  The problem I'm having is with the Cisco initiating.  

My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it's just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it's simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I'm stumped.  

I have my ACL, transform-set, crypto-map, NAT exclusion - I think everything is there.  I can ping the SW's WAN from the Cisco CLI.  PCAP in the SW doesn't show any attempts to even start phase 1.

The router is first connected to a seperate router (I believe an Arris model, lost my note), then a switch and our Point of Sale stations and printers, all by ethernet.

Secondly, the Comcast router is connected to a Luxul Switch, which is then connected to 3 PoE injectors, and then 3 Luxul APs. 2 are for our guest WiFi network, and 1 for Office/Administrative network.

Lastly, the comcast router is connected to a DVR for our multiple coaxial cameras.

The wireless signal itself is pretty consistent and strong, but some devices connected are often unable to connect to the internet or appear to be connected but recieve DNS errors or are just unable to do anyhting online.

I was wondering if anybody has experience in configuring DHCP server in RHEL 7 or upwards. We will be provided with a RHEL or CentOS OS (version 7 probably) to configure as a central or global DHCP server for many subnets connected to the central DHCP server by third party transport network. Each subnet's gateway will be configured with DHCP Relay. I included a [picture](https://imgur.com/PcrFTt1) detailing the situation if it helps.

You can clearly see the DHCP clients are not residing in the server's subnet (that's why the DHCP relays). But RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 dictates that DHCP server will only provide or feed dynamic IP address to the subnet in it's own interface. Basically, it will look at it's own interface's IP configuration and feed IP to that subnet, if I am understand correctly. RHEL 6 had provision for configuring which interface it'll listen to in /etc/sysconfig/dhcpd file but that file is deprecated in RHEL 7 or more.

**So any idea how can we feed IP address from DHCP server to a client not in the local broadcast domain of the DHCP server?**

In terms of the image I provided, the DHCP server have only one interface to listen to ([10.21.125.60](https://10.21.125.60) /24). And it has to feed an IP address to a client is subnet #1 . So what do we need to do in dhcpd.conf file?

i'm looking for a new Hardware vendor for a specific purpose.

We are going to integrate a new Layer2 circuit provider that will deliver Layer2 transport services  up to 900 MBit/s on a 10G E-NNI Link. These virtual EPL Circuits allow a maximum burst (Bc) of 12,5 kBytes (MEF recommendation) , independent of the bandwidth.

Unfortunately i can't use our Juniper MX boxes to produce internet services based on this new Layer2 services because the minimum burst that the MX can deliver is a Tc of about 1,69ms which completely saturates the WAN circuit and is leading to excessive drops and a very bad TCP performance.

So i'm looking for an alternative edge router for this use case. 

The first (and most direct) idea is to switch to Cisco ASR1000 that has a quite powerful shaper performance and is able to produce a nearly zero-burst CIR.

I am having a weird issue that i am trying to fix for a couple of days.

Here goes:

My /23 subnet \[1 Mikrotik Router(ccr1036)\] \[My Own Public AS \]   ------ BGP ------- PROVIDER 1   

\------  BGP ------- PROVIDER 2     

If i announce my network /23 to both providers some of my websites hosted on ip's from my /23 network wont load when accessing them via the browser (chrome,firefox).

The very weird thing is that traceroute, ping, telnet(80,443) works to the websites /23 ip's or fqdn but sites wont load in the browser.

If i announce my /23 to only 1 (either of them) of the providers everything works well and all my websites loads correctly.

If anyone can give me a hint will me much appreciated.

For example, you can not tell a specific host to use a specific boot server or a different name-server, etc..  Only the host name and IP can be specified for a specific host. You can only specify other dhcp attributes for the entire pool.

That seems like a core feature of a dhcp server and I am trying to figure out what to make of it not being addressed by juniper in over 4 years.

In general, neither SRX dhcp implementation seems very complete and issues brought up on j-net are not addressed by juniper. The operational commands to monitor the leases/bindings are not very robust. You can not tell if a lease is a associated with a static binding. The newer jdhcp daemon does not support listing the static bindings at all until a client obtains a lease against it!

The problem is that its randomly stops working, and the issue is that the link to the switch goes down, i can move the terminal to ANY other port and nothing happens, if i plug in a PC in the same port it works instantly. Its almost as if the MAC is banned or something, but the switch is a very old HP and have no such feature that i know of. 

Ive tried turning off STP and all other features on one port but i cant get it to establish a link, there is nothing in the logs (Because the switch is so old) that says anything about the port.

Some context;
I have several routers iBGP peering with each other, enabled for the IPv4 and VPNv4 address families.
The global table on these routers connects to the internet, learns a default route which is redistributed, all happy.
There are several MPLS VRFs, VPNv4 routes being exchanged successfully, also happy.
Several (virtual) devices act as gateways to their respective MPLS networks, eBGP peering with both their VRF and the global table - no issues.

Now rather than just a default route, I need to start ingesting the full internet table and redistributing it into my iBGP.
My concern is that my router will try to allocate a label for every single global destination prefix, and exceed some capacity. I'm doing some reading on LDP merging but it sounds like it's only relevant for P routers.

So what's the solution? And if any of my understanding is incorrect please let me know.
- Run MPLS VPNs and Internet tables on different hardware?
- Different iBGP peering(s) for IPv4 and VPNv4, and keep IPv4 off LDP interfaces? 
- Run the internet table in it's own VRF so there are many fewer outer MPLS labels? Not even sure if this would work because there's still the inner label?

I have inherited a small network in an office building which provides an internet connection for a Mitel PBX and a handful of Mitel VOIP phones. This network used to have a household Netgear router at its core and I have now upgraded to a Netgate SG-5100 running pfSense.

The issue I'm struggling with is that due to people working remotely we have the need for a few of these Mitel phones to work from the users' homes. This was functioning fine using the Netgear router configured by the previous IT admins but I'm having trouble with TFTP and pfSense.

I have gone as far as configuring a 1 to 1 NAT from a public IP to the PBX and allowing any and all traffic but the phones still fail to provision via TFTP. I have also enabled the ""TFTP Proxy"" available in pfSense on all cominations of the interfaces but I still cant get it to work.

If anyone has any ideas I would really appreciate the input.

Thanks.

EDIT: NOW RESOLVED. pfSense works fine. Don't blindly trust information from vendors.

So I braved Covid-19 and went on site to troubleshoot in person today. Long story short, I am guilty of the first sin of IT and I did not verify the information given to me by the VOIP vendor... I assumed that he knew what the IP of his own TFTP server was. So now that I figured out for them what the correct IP is and adjusted the NAT accordingly the phones provision just fine.

We had a small issue of one way audio after that but I just had to add an outbound NAT mapping with static port set so that pfSense would not rewrite the source port of the outbound PBX traffic. That and making sure the phone was set to ""NAT"" mode instead of ""native"" in the PBX.

to begin with: I originally posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/gfeiae/expanding_to_a_new_site_with_their_own_second/) in r/HomeNetworking but didn't get a single reply. I guess this was too advanced for them. I'm usually the guy that answers posts there but this is even for me too new.

# Short version:

I currently have 3 sites (connected via NanoStations), one EdgeRouter 4, and a bunch of VLANS. This ER4 is the single point for inter-VLAN-routing and internet access. I want to connect another Family and their business to our network so we can share internal traffic but their private/business traffic uses their ISP and not ours.

# Miscellaneous:

I have a good knowledge about VLAN and firewall rules but only basic knowledge about NAT rules and no L3 and static routing knowledge. I fear that I need to use the latter for this project though. I am an IT-Student and worked a little bit as a 2nd level support for MS networks but got laid off until covid disappears. I have very good computer knowledge and networking is my hobby. My ""home lab"" is my running config though so I can only do stuff in the night but I'm kinda nocturnal anyway.

(just to be clear, we're the same family, but operate different businesses. We get along but don't want to share everything)I belong to Family 1, so if you find words like ""us, me, our"" then they refer to Family 1.""their"" is Family 2.

# Long Version:

Here's a simplified network diagram of the network: [https://imgur.com/a/rkgwr2a](https://imgur.com/a/rkgwr2a)There's also a description on the picture which I have written before I wrote this post. Some information may be new but I try to include everything in more details here. The diagram does not depict every single device. Only network devices and important ones for this project.

# Current Situation:

* All Sites but ""E"" are connected as depicted.
* Everything runs over the EdgeRouter 4 on ""Site A"". ""Site D"" is owned by ""Family 2"" but uses our internet because they're right next to our property (""Site B"") and don't need much bandwidth.
* ""Family 2"" also owns ""Site E"", which is a restaurant.
* The links always carry all VLANS because we have 9 different SSIDs for the VLANS (except for ""VLAN 60"" which is wired only) and all APs broadcast them.
* Network equipment is on ""VLAN 10"". I see it as a ""management"" VLAN. My devices are on ""VLAN 50"" and firewall rules allows them to access ""VLAN 10"".

# Additional info:

* Family 1 has static IP addresses.
* Family 2 currently does not.
* Family 1 has 80 down, 15 up.
* Family 2 currently has 25 down, 10 up (but it varies a lot).

# The Hardware:

* An EdgeRouter 4 is used as the router.
* The switches are currently from different vendors. I'm planning on buying some EdgeSwitches for better integration with UNMS. (As soon as I gather 10 devices for their hosted service)The one at ""Site B"" will most likely be replaced with one as we need a new switch for expanding ""Site B"" anyway and then we'll move the current Zyxel Switch one link downwards to the new building. I'm not certain whether it needs L3 features (EdgeSwitch 8). You guys tell me please!
* The Access Points are tp-link EAPs. The management controller is located at Site A.
* All the network equipment at ""Site E"" does not exist yet. They currently run on the ISP Modem/Wireless-Router Combo and a dumb switch for the cash register.

# The goals:

* ""Site E"" still has all VLANS from Family 1 so Employees and us can roam around BUT traffic from ""Family 2"" VLANS (which do not exist yet) should use their ISP, including VLAN 70.Optionally: All traffic happening on their site goes through their ISP.
* ""Site E"" needs to operate even if the Link to ""Site B"" drops.(This might be an issue if they use the Pi-hole on ""VLAN 10"". I'm not certain what happens to the access points if they lose connection to the controller. I believe they would still work though.)If the link is down, the VLANS from Family 1 may go down as well. Ideally they'd use the Family 2 ISP, but not required. Guests however should stay online and I strongly believe that they require access to the EAP management controller for the captive portal. That might need a site-2-site VPN connection incase the link fails. (I hope that the link is stable though, so just keep it in mind, but don't see it as a requirement just yet)
* There's a guest network on all sites. As the sites are all on the same street, guests should be able to roam around between the sites. Almost the whole street is covered by our access points. Traffic happening at Site.

55,t3_ghqcoj,"Hello,  


We've been using NPS (2x NPS servers with Aruba IAPs) with machine authentication for a while now without any issue. We've just received a new batch of devices (laptops, tablets) and after deployment, we realized they do not want to connect to our secure network. Everything on the clients seems fine, they have a computer certificate, are domain-joined and get the policies from GPO. At first, I thought it was an issue with those new devices, but after wiping my own (old batch) PC to test, it doesn't work either. So I thought it might've been something with our OS deployment, but today I wiped another old computer and this one works with our secure wireless network. This working computer has the exact same drivers as my personal computer (which doesn't work). It seems to me ""Machine authentication"" is not working with those devices as I get a prompt for username/password. I am at a complete loss as to what causes this and need to fix it before the lockdown is lifted or else things are not looking good.  


On the NPS server logs, nothing seems out of place. When a computer authenticates, it shows the computer account object as a ""user"". When I try to use a computer that doesn't work, it just prompts me for user/password and that fails as we use machine auth. I don't know why it's not forcing trying machine auth. The NPS server certificate is valid. Certificate stores for a working vs non-working machines are identical.

SOLUTION:
With Credential Guard, it seems like some auths won't work. We were using PEAP-MSCHAPV2. (See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-considerations)

Wi-fi and VPN Considerations

When you enable Windows Defender Credential Guard, you can no longer use NTLM classic authentication for Single Sign-On. You will be forced to enter your credentials to use these protocols and cannot save the credentials for future use. If you are using WiFi and VPN endpoints that are based on MS-CHAPv2, they are subject to similar attacks as for NTLMv1. For WiFi and VPN connections, Microsoft recommends that organizations move from MSCHAPv2-based connections such as PEAP-MSCHAPv2 and EAP-MSCHAPv2, to certificate-based authentication such as PEAP-TLS or EAP-TLS.

Even if I applied what was suggested online to mitigate this without affecting current users, it did not work. I changed the NPS policies to only use Certificate auth and the 802.1X GPO to EAP-TTLS. All clients can now connect but those who had the old policy will have to be gpupdate'd some way, or I'll have to push something from Intune.",Issue with NPS not authenticating some Windows clients,r/networking,0.72,6,9,{},0

I have a weird issue. I recently replaced an old Draytek router with a Juniper SRX100B.

The network is pretty simple, there are two VLANS connected to the firewall with just a small handful of servers connected. There is also a site-to-site VPN connected to a data centre.

Site-to-site VPN seems to work fine, I have Exchange replication between them and this is working fine.

The issue i've got, is that internet access from servers on the VLANS connected to the Juniper are very very slow and in most cases anything TCP just doesn't work.

So, from the servers I can steadily ping [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and not drop a single packet. If I try to go on a website, 90% of the time it will take forever to load or just completely fail. An apt-get update from an Ubuntu server also fails. 

DNS resolution looks to be working fine, for some reason it seems anything TCP out to the WAN just doesn't wanna work.

The config on the Juniper is pretty basic really, there is an outbound firewall rule allowing anything from trust (the VLANS) to untrust (The WAN)

We use their access points/switches (never routers/firewalls) and the camera gear. The fact that their cameras included ""free"" NVR and the networking gear included a ""free"" controller was a nice touch. 

But as with all things, it appears when it is ""free"", you are the product.

The last few firmware/controller releases, UBNT has been collecting telemetry, first starting without making it obvious to us that they were doing so. It was an opt-out rather than an opt-in. The most recent release, they've begun collecting even more data and making it very hard to stop it. My concern is even if I stop it, there is nothing stopping them from pushing out another update that collects more data.

89,t3_gftmhz,"Hello,

First, I'm so sorry for some stupid questions I may ask. I'm doing my best at my level of knowledge.

I'm working for a year now in a high school, and we plan to change our network infrastructure. From the opening 20 years ago (that was a small high school at that time), it has been a flat network. It is now fragmented into VLANs (into the same network, yes), and thanks to Huawei hybrid vlan, we can say ""that vlan can communicate with that vlan, but not with that vlan,  even if they both are in the same network"". But it's a ""all or nothing"", of course as it's layer 2 we cannot filter on ports.

This brings us great performances as it's a full layer 2 ""network"", BUT it's a bad security option, and it's quite horrible to manage.

I would like to transform this in order to have a more standard topology, easier to understand, to manage and with as good performances. Here is what we have in terms of needs:

* 2500 students
* 20 classrooms with around 40 computers per room, those classrooms are in 3 buildings (8 - 8 - 4) within 5000m²
* 50TB iSCSI shared by multiple active directories (SMB, complex NTFS rights) to those 800 computers
* This 50TB SMB share is also shared by SFTP on the internet through another dedicated server
* There is multiple licences servers
* We need a great bandwidth between those 50TB share and computers, big amounts of data are transferred as it's mainly 3D projects,...
* There are also multiple (around 20) web servers/dbs for high school services
* Computers within a classroom can communicate together, but can't communicate with other classrooms

&amp;#x200B;

I already checked the most popular options for big networks:

* 3-tier topology: I've got shared feelings because of this:
   * Aggregation layer, that is meant to route trafic beneath the aggregation switch L3 wouldn't route anything as there is anything to route between classrooms
   * I don't know where I should put servers:
      * 50TB Share at core layer for better performances? But It may be better to evitate coming to the core to access a file share? So not the ideal topology for our use case?
      * Should the other servers be under a distribution switch?
* Spine-leaves: Seems too complex and not suitable for our use case (also very expensive)
   * I guess we can have something easier for such an easy use case: 800 computers must access to one share with great performances, to internet and to multiple licences servers.

We also had a question about DMZ: In our case, the SFTP server that shares to the internet our 50TB iscsi should definitely be in the DMZ. But this SFTP server is linked to a SMB share, which is shared by a DC, which is linked to the iSCSI. Should that DC be in the DMZ? That would make no sense to put a DC inside a DMZ, but then I don't see how to publish on this share on the internet without having such a security issue.

Thank you VERY MUCH in advance for all your recommandations and ideas.

Apparently [Cisco TAC support services for the pay as you go CSR is available for purchase through any Cisco Partner](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Cisco-Systems-Inc-Cisco-Cloud-Services-Router-CSR-/B00OCG4OAA).

From reading further on that page, it looks like there are SKUs for various throughput levels and AWS instance sizes.

So... How does this work? Buy the contract and then attach an AWS UDI key?

Is there a way to handle ephemeral-ish CSR workloads? Like an auto-scale group for DMVPN or AnyConnect?

What if I do upgrades by replacing one CSR instance with another running a new software release?

99,t3_gfd2ok,"Hi, I wonder if anyone could share their experience / opinion about integrating two-factor authentication into Win2016 RRAS? We have been using simple L2TP for few remote users over years. Due to our business nature, we don't heavily rely on remote access, until the recent shelter-in-place. And we foresee that it could become ""normal"" down the road so we wanna a better protection.

I never did that before and Google search brings me a lot of info. Look like MS doesn't have one native come with RRAS. I saw few 3rd party options like Duo, or SAASPASS. But I have zero experience so I am looking for some. Hopefully, it would be just like FB, whenever the RRAS detects a login from a new IP, it sends out a txt, or email, or asking for the 6-digit code like Reddit does. We are not looking for a big complicate system. We have around 200 users in office. But during the normal time, we might have only 5 random connection over a month. So I am sure my boss will not want to pay monthly for this, but paying by connection license would be an option.

Some of you might agree with me. By working with some old age top management, it is very difficult to convince them making a 8-chars password would be much safer than just ""1qaz"". Yes, my boss never implement password enforcement policy as 99.9% of logins would be on LAN only.

104,t3_gf6w1h,"Cisco Firepower 2130 w/ASA code and Microsoft Windows 10 VPN client (Always On) using IKEv2 w/AES-128 with Machine certificate authentication.  

Draft: #1

Hopefully this will help out anyone trying to get MS Windows 10 (always on) VPN working with ASA.  I was having some issues online trying to find out more information on how to set this up.  I got it working in my environment so figured I would try to share something I learned.  

&amp;#x200B;

But Motavar why? Questions:  

\- Why Cisco ASA and not a MS VPN /RAS box.  Unfortunately spinning up another set of VPN services results in additional systems to support. From servers, to network route changes, firewall changes,  to border security, to ownership, documentation, everything.  Sometimes it may be easier to point new VPN clients to an existing VPN headend (Cisco ASA) which is already setup. 

\- Why MS VPN Client.  ""Some People"" wanted to move to Always on VPN over AnyConnect. Not my call..

&amp;#x200B;

Please Note:

\- This documentation assumes your Cisco Firepower 2130 ASA is running 9.13.x code to support Appliance mode. I'm not going to go into details on how to do this.. 

\- We are also assuming that under your ""AnyConnect Connection Profiles"" section you enabled ""Allow user to select connection profile on the login page"" is checked and you're using a custom connection profile for AnyConnect users. 

NOTE: This is important since a custom profile for AnyConnect will make sure your users are not using the ""DefaultRAGroup"" for connetions.

NOTE2: 3rd party VPN clients such as the MS Windows 10 VPN client will be using the ""DefaultRAGroup"" for the connection. You have to make sure no other IPSec/AnyConnect clients will be connecting to this group.  We are going to modify this for MS clients use only.

\- We are assuming you rolled out Machine certs from a local CA. Also make sure your machine certs have a subject name field or else the connection will fail as the ASA uses the SN for tracking who connected.  Without a Subject field you won't be able to connect. 

\- We are assuming you are using MS VPN Client for Windows 10 that supports IKEv2 w/PFS 

\- We are assuming most work is done in ASDM

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lets Begin!

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: Some timers/settings may vary on your particular setup. So make changes as needed for your org. This is only a helpful framework to get you closer to getting your MS clients to connect.  You know your environment so the changes you make and what you break... is on YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Create a Group Policy:

\------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Group Policies""

&amp;#x200B;

\* In this example we are creating a Group Policy called ""AOVPN"" for Always On VPN.

So create group policy ""AOVPN"".

Inside of the policy setup set your max connection time to ""unlimited"" and Idle timeout to ""30 Minutes""

&amp;#x200B;

\* Setup your DNS, scopes, etc

&amp;#x200B;

IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is required for PFS use: Failure to do this step will result in the VPN client failing to pass traffic after re-key event. The default MS VPN client IPSEC Child SA settings are 3600 seconds and /250000k. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Go to Advanced section and down to IPSec(IKEV1) client.  Enable PFS (perfect forward secrecy"". While this is listed under the IKEv1 section it's actually used in the IKEv2 settings.  Yah, Go Cisco!

 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Setup your IKEv2 Policies and IPSec Proposals

\------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Advanced"".  Then down to ""IPSec"" tree item and down to ""IKE Policies"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under IKEv2 Policies create an Entry as follows:

DH Group 14, Encryption AES, Integrity Hash ""sha256"" and Pseudo Random Function PRF hash ""sha256"" and lifetime 86400 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\* Setup your IPsec Proposals (Transform Sets).

Go down a menu item to ""IPsec Proposals (Transform Sets)."" 

Under IKE V2 IPsec Proposals:

create an entry with AES and Integrity Hash ""sha-256""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Apply the IPSec Proposals to your Crypto Maps

\-----------------------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Advanced"".  Then down to ""IPSec"" tree item and down to ""Crypto Maps"".

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: This is important because while we created the IKEv2 settings they are not added to the dynamic crypto map for some reason..

&amp;#x200B;

\* Find your ""Dynamic: 65535.x"" dynamic map for outside/inside and edit it:

Under the ""Tunnel Policy (crypto map) - Basic"" tab find the ""ike v2 ipsec proposal"" section and add in ""AES-128/sha-256"" IKEv2 proposal we created above. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Put a check mark next to ""Perfect Forwarding Secrecy "" and select Diffie-Hellman Group:  Group 14

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Install your CA Certificate for Machine cert auth:

\--------------

\* From your Internal CA create a cert and install that onto the ASA

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Certificate Management"""" at the top tree menu and down to ""Identity Certificates"". Pop in your cert and/or go up to CA certs and add it there.  This is used for the machine cert authentication.

\* Name the Associated Trustpoint something like ""VPNMachineCert""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Setup the IPSec(IKEv2) Connection Profiles

\-------------------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to IPSec (IKEv2) Connection Profiles"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Find ""DefaultRAGroup"" and check the box under ""IKEv2 Enabled"".

&amp;#x200B;

Edit the ""DefaultRAGroup"" and perform the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Check box next to ""Enable Certificate Authentication"" under the IKE Peer Authentication section

&amp;#x200B;

\-Check Box next to ""Enable RSA signature Hash"" under the RSA signature section. NOTE: This is used when AES is enabled in the MS VPN Client. If using default settings in the MS Client I believe this may not be used.

&amp;#x200B;

\- In the IKE Local Authentication section: Check the box ""Enable local authentication"" and select ""Certificate"".  In the dropdown box select the cert we want to use.. the trustpoint name would be ""VPNMachineCert"" or whatever you called it. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- User Authentication section server group would be LOCAL

\- Setup your DHCP stuff.. 

\- Default Group Policy:  Select the group policy ""AOVPN"" that we created earlier. Make sure ""Enable IKEv2 Protocol"" is checked below that item.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the left menu tree go into the ""Advanced"" section and down to ""Authorization"". Under authorization section select ""use the entire DN as the username"".

&amp;#x200B;

I believe no other settings are required so okay and exit out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Enable Interfaces for IKEv2

\--------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""AnyConnect Connetion Profiles"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Make sure ""IPSec (IKEv2) Access is enabled on your inside/outside intefaces. So check mark ""allow access"" and ""enable client services"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Find the ""DefaultRAGroup"" and edit it.  Confirm the following:

Authentication AAA/Local group

Confirm client address pools

Confirm the group policy is still ""Aovpn""

confirm ""enable IPSEC(ikev2) client protocol is checked and DNS/Domain info is in there. 

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: Most likely all this was already configured under the IKEV2 settinsg from before but doesn't hurt to check it here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

MS Windows 10 VPN client. 

\---------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* Windows 10 - in your search bar type ""VPN"" and bring up the VPN settings.

\* Create a VPN connection

VPN Provider: Windows (Built-in)

Connection name ""VPN""

server: your ASA outside IP /DNS name

VPN Type: IKEv2

Type of sign-in info:  certificate

check box next to rememebr my sign-in info.

Save that 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Go into your Windows 10 settings section and find ""Network &amp; Internet""

Select ""change adapter options""

Find your VPN adapter and right-click it:

go to properties and over to the ""Security"" tab:

under the ""Data Encryption"" section move the check box to ""use machine certificates"".

Okay out and save that 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final steps...

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have to harden/change the VPN setup to use AES..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

MS Windows 10 VPN client (harden)

\------------------

\* Command prompt /admin time..   so launch a command prompt

\* Launch powershell

\* Enter the following:

$connection = ""VPN""

Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration -ConnectionName $connection -AuthenticationTransformConstants SHA256128 -CipherTransformConstants AES128 -DHGroup Group14 -EncryptionMethod AES128 -IntegrityCheckMethod SHA256 -PFSgroup PFS2048 -Force

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Launch the VPN client:

\------------------

Click your windows network icon in the lower right and launch the VPN client and connect.  Debug whatever you need to do on the ASA to confirm working.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

AFTER TESTING CONNECTIVITY NOW ITS TIME FOR REVOCATION:

We save this for last since revocation can be a pita to test.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Setup Certificate Revocation 

\-------------------------

\* Back into ASDM

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Certificate Management"""" at the top tree menu and down to ""CA Certificates"". 

\* Find the Trust point for the Machine certs.. something like ""VPNMachineCert""

\* Edit the Trust Point:

under ""revocation check"" table enable ""Check certificates for revocation"".

Move CRL over to the right side.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under the ""CRL retrieval policy""

Check box ""use CRL distribution point from the certificate""

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under the CRL retrieval method"" 

Disable LDAP

Enable HTTP

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under the ""advanced"" tab:

update your cache timers.  Mine is 60 mines

check box ""enforce next crl update""

other options:  

I have accept certs issued by this CA

Accept certs from the subordinate CAs of this CA

leave CRL check none: (we'll fix this)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And finally... to work around ADSM bug with Enabling the CRL check

\-----------------

\* SSH to your VPN gateway and enable yourself

\* Config T

&amp;#x200B;

Enter into your trust point (example)

&amp;#x200B;

type:  crypto ca trustpoint VPNUSER\_CA

type:  revocation-check crl

type:  crl configure

type:  no protocol ldap

&amp;#x200B;

Note: most likely no protocol ldap was already enabled but .. meh.. you have it again :)

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE2: Perform the steps above for any TrustPoints that have -1 or -2 or whatever else was created. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Revocation Time

\------------

Have your server friends put your machine cert on hold.

Then have them push out the revocation to sub ca's

Then go into ASDM trust point and retrieve CRLS and confirm your client is blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

Then unrevoke, push out changes on server, retrieve CRLS on the ASA and test you can re-connect.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When Revocation/or un-revoke doesnt work:

\------------------

When in doubt do the following:

Have the server team push out revocation changes to the Sub CAs or whatever they do (again).

Go into ASDM and over to the ""Monitoring"" tab at the top and down to ""properties"" in the lower left corner.  

In the Tree menu find ""CRL"" and go into that section.

View ALL CRLs...

Delete /clear all CRLS

Go back to your trust point and update CRLs.

Test again after a minute. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. Timestamp shows the passed time since the last displayed packet: I see long delays (+20seconds) at some points.
3. I went down the TCPstream until I recognized some of the packet bytes that contain the first command from my code which is meant for the endpoint. (packet #2020)
4. I opened a tcptrace from server1 to server2 and found that this packet #2020 is sent 46 seconds after the TCP stream started.
5. After the start of the TCPstream, I see a 22sec delay, some throughput, and then a delay again for 22 seconds after which the actual command stream starts and then finishes after 6seconds.
6. Looking at the packetstream, each block of data (DCERPC protocol) that comes through is ended by a TCP ACK and then a long delay.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to go from here to figure out what's going on. Any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

Found a mistake: I used a display filter \[ip.src == A &amp;&amp; ip.dst == B\], but forgot to add the inverse.  Now I see all packets back and forth...

My point 6 is thus wrongly interpreted. There is a response from server B saying TCP \[SYN, CWR, ECN\]. This interrupts the connection and results in a DCERPC fault stating the RPC server is unavailable.

Does this mean the application is sending too much data?

After initial setup and verifying that the Bridge is connected and working as intended, i did some ping checks to test the other devices, and here is where i dont get how this is possible. Both the WiFi Bridge and Switch are out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.

Here is a small michelangelo to show what pings work and which dont (it looks as confusing as it is to me)

my main confusion right now is why the switch cannot ping ANYTHING at all, even though the connection from laptop to laptop or laptop to wifi bridge works.

110,t3_gf0doj,"I have been running in circle for the past few hours trying to solve this. I have a ASA (SiteB) with two site-to-site VPNs connected to it:

SiteA and SiteC

Both site to site VPN are working fine. But I am trying to set up a double NAT hairpinning so that the devices at SiteC can reach a server at siteA.

SiteA servers: 10.10.x.x

SiteB devices: 172.17.1.x

SiteC devices: 172.17.2.x

Internal devices at SiteB can reach the server at SiteA using a double NAT, but when I use a similar double NAT for the traffic from SiteC, it seems like the ASA is only translating the source IP and not the destination.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the config on SiteB ASA:

    nat (inside,outside) source static INTERNAL-NETWORKS NAT-INTERNAL-NETWORKS destination static NAT-SERVER REAL-SERVER
    
    nat (outside,outside) source static SITEC-NETWORKS NAT-SITEC-NETWORKS destination static NAT-SERVER REAL-SERVER

This is the error I am getting in the log:

Customer has two WatchGuard M200s in a Active/Passive configuration and in this configuration you need to have everything patched to both the M200s concurrently (e.g. LAN, DMZ, Internet etc.) so that in a failure it will failover within 1-2 packet drops.

\#Primary Issue#

The customer has a NBN FTTP internet connection that has a single ethernet hand off from the NTD - this needs to be plugged into two M200's concurrently.

They have been plugging the ethernet hand off into a 5-port hub switch then having two other ports plug into the M200s. 

They currently have stacked N3000 L3 POE switches that would be a much better use case than an non-managed / non-redundant hub switch.

Now i've configured the N3000's with a port channel (e.g. PO4) on the interfaces gi1/0/44-45 &amp; gi2/0/44-45 with switchport access vlan 30 configured.

The concept was that you would plug in the ethernet hand off into gi1/0/44 then have gi1/0/45 &amp; gi2/0/45 plugged into the M200s (gi2/0/44 in case gi1/0/44 dies, you simply move the ethernet hand off). 

The issue is that when I plugged in these ports from the N3000s into the M200s the interface is shown as failed on the watchguard. 

I'm assuming that it might be because I've not configured the WatchGuard external internet interface with the VLAN ID and/or no link aggregation - would this be correct or is there anything else that needs to be considered?

119,t3_gesdop,"So I always questioned this as this is the third time i'm now seeing this.  And for what it's worth, i'm using the IOS-XR O/S.

We have our aggregate routers in our core in which we have all of our static to null's for our larger prefixes.  Not to get into too many of the technicalities of the physical topology, because it's def not ideal and we're in the midst of changing it, but for discussion's sake, say Site B hangs off of Site A, which in turn is connected to the ""internet"".  Site B advertises a /22 to Site A.  Site A has a static to Null for that /22 with an AD of 250 set.  When you do a route lookup on Site A to this /22, it shows as an eBGP peer.  

This link went down between the two Agg routers in both sites and thus, the static to null for this /22 took precedence.  When the link came back up, the static to null was still there, and the lower AD /22 route did not take precedence.

Is this because they're the same length even though the static to null has a higher AD?  I would think the eBGP AD of 20 would trump the 250 we have configured even with the same prefix length.",Why is a static to null route with a higher AD still preferred over the same length prefix from eBGP peer?,r/networking,0.92,43,30,{},0
120,t3_ges2bu,"Hi all, I'm busy beating my head against the wall as we can not figure out an issue we're having with a Site-to-site VPN tunnel we are trying to setup.

We use Cisco equipment, and recently purchased a Cradlepoint router to use as a failover. we configured the cradlepoint in IP Passthrough and purchased a static IP from Verizon.

We are able to get out to the internet with this interface, but unable to bring up the VPN tunnel, as the peer does not respond. (MM\_WAIT\_MSG2)

We have double checked, and triple checked to config. Our primary outside interface comes up fine and without issue, but we are pretty stumped on this one. Using nmap from a computer on the inside interface, the peer connection we are trying to connect to shows port 500 as open.

I was wondering if there was a tool that can summarise the gaps between these in use /24 subnets? I have done it already using a quick Excel sheet to visualise it but summarising the spare subnets is still a manual process with room for error.

124,t3_geo1ub,"We have supposedly 1Gbps circuits in Huntsville AL and the other in Seattle, Washington. They both supposedly have a 300Mbps billing rate with 1Gbps burstable. The RTT between the two sites is about 78ms.

In iperf3 I can hit exactly 300Mbps on a single stream.

Server1: iperf3 -s
server2: iperf3 -c server1 -R -t 60


This results in exactly 300Mbps for the 60s test. It will fluctuate to like 298, 301, 300, 300, 296, 300, 306, 302, 301, 299, 300, 300 etc.

Server1: iperf3 -s
server2: iperf3 -c server1 -R -P 4

It will get a total of about 850-870Mbps or about 210-220 per stream. If I run 2 streams they will each be 300Mbps.

This seems too much of a coincidence that a single stream will hit 300Mbps and our supposed provisioned in 300Mbps.

**SOLVED**

My private subnet only allowed traffic from my `10.0.0.0/16` VPC but the VPN is on `10.8.0.0/16`.

Changing the private security group to include the VPN CIDR made it work.

---

First of all, I apologies if it's not the good place for posting.
But, while I'm not sure it's an AWS or OpenVPN issue, I'm positive it's a networking one.

Also, I'm new to all this, from AWS to VPN and networking in general.
Don't hesitate to tell me if I need to give more detail of any sort.
Despite the fact I'm new to it, it's for my work place, not home networking at all.

Feel free to remove this post if I'm definitively lost.
If you keep it, I'll be able to cross post on r/aws and r/openvpn.

---

So, here is the thing : https://gitlab.com/pcoves/vpn_test

This is a small network (single VPC) hosted on AWS composed of :
1. One OpenVPN server with a public IPv4 address on a public subnet (10.0.0.0/24),
2. Two Debian instances in a private subnet (10.0.1.0/24) that can be joined from within the VPC.

Note that the VPN server [does](https://gitlab.com/pcoves/vpn_test/-/blob/master/packer/ansible/roles/openvpn/files/server.conf#L22) `push ""route 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0""` so that the client is aware of the AWS subnet.

I can `ssh` from my local box to the VPN server (using either it's public ip or `10.8.0.1` so I know the VPN is working) and from there, I can `ssh` to the private instances.
Once I'm on the private instances, I can `ping`/`ssh` back to the VPN server.
So, I know, each machine can communicate with the other on the `10.0.0.0/16` VPC.

Now, I'd like to access my private subnet from my local box through the VPN.
As far as I understand, when I do `ping 10.0.1.*` from my local (192.168.*.*) box, it goes to the VPN server, then goes to the private machine (I don't know how to verify that, you know, new to networking... Open to suggestion).
Once there, the `ping` has to *come back* but the private machine has no clue what `10.8.0.1` (the VPN server) so the packets are lost.

So, my question really is : what does one has to do in order to route the packets from the private subnet to the local machine through the VPN?

Many thanks in advance for your patience!

PS : many pages on the net advise to disable the *source/dest check* on the VPN server instance.

138,t3_gehxc6,"My company is currently working to provide a large enterprise customer with a private AWS web application accessed via IPSec tunnels. We are in initial discussion with the customer's various IT/Networking teams but are working out possible architectures before the full design coordination meeting.

&amp;nbsp;

**Key components of our current VPC design:**

* VPC is a /16 RFC 1918 space e.g. 10.1.0.0/16
* Access to the application is via an internal AWS ALB with multiple AZs.  
* The ALB client endpoint IPs are private and dynamically assigned and updated in DNS.


**Anticipated Customer Constraints**

* To avoid IP conflicts, Customer will not peer/reserve/route to RFC 1918
* We need to provide target IPs in advance (static IPs/CIDRs)
* Future changes are slow.  Stable design is important upfront.

&amp;nbsp;

We are looking at ways to solve this and came across what is probably a bad idea, but we can't see why.

&amp;nbsp;

What if our company purchased and registered a public /24 but did not advertise routes on the public internet.  Instead we add our new public range to the VPC as usable IPs (again not publicly routable or registered with AWS for public advertisement).  We then configure the load balancer to use IPs from this CIDR as it's endpoint addresses.  

&amp;nbsp;

To the customer, we provide this new privately-owned ""public"" range which they route across our B2B IPSec tunnel. 

Conceivably this guarantees no conflicts on their end and makes it easy for us to dynamically use IPs from a given subnet (rather than randomly assigned non-contiguous AWS EIPs).  


&amp;nbsp;

Here's the crazy idea:  What if we reused this architecture and ""public"" CIDR with multiple customers (lets say 25 unique large enterprises)?  

&amp;nbsp;

*Pros:*

* We only have to buy one public CIDR block.
* Design is standard and reproducible for customers
* Customer only has to configure routes for a single subnet rather than multiple /32 addresses.

*Cons:*

* Our org cannot access multiple customer stacks simultaneously without DNAT. (not an issue for us)
* Cannot advertise public CIDR on the internet.

Configuration B:

Server with name name.domain.tld again. Server is on a different subnet than internal clients. Internal DNS and external DNS both resolve the name to the public IP. Requests from both internal and external clients traverse a firewall which statically NATs both requests to the private IP.

I don't get to see much public facing configuration done by others, so I don't have a good sense of what's standard and 2. When I do see public facing configuration done by others, they don't even bother segregating publicly-accessible systems at all, so I can't really ever gauge what's correct by what I see others doing.

I'm dealing with roughly 1000 domain joined Windows devices, and 1000 non-domain joined devices being a mix of Windows, Mac and Linux.
Not worried about pads and smartphones, those dont get to access the corporate network.

I got my automated certificate deployment mechanism in place for all domain and non-domain joined devices. Either their Kerberos token is used, or when its not present or valid their AD username/password/MFA-code is used. Temp hires use a usr/pwd based in a separate LDAP. 
Also got the CN &amp; SAN DNS values automatically registered in the Radius.

The issued certificates are valid for 10 hours (ie 1 work day)

So the chicken-or-egg problem is: 
I need a certificate to access the corporate network, but I need some form of local network access to get a certificate.

I could simply configure a VLAN1 and a VLAN2.
VLAN1 is where someone ends up when no valid certificate is present and can obtain a certificate, and VLAN2 would be the corporate network accessible with a valid certificate and corresponding private key

To enforce certificate re-authentication, when a device/user is in VLAN1 and gets the cert, they must switch to VLAN2, it seems I can only enforce this by having a user kill the network connection and turn it on again. Hardly user friendly.

Is there any way to make this network re-auth more user friendly? Preferably have someone re-authenticate automatically within mere seconds after obtaining the certificate?

The assumption here is that you have a server behind a firewall, with the public side being untrusted and the the private side being trusted.  If this server needs to be accessed from the public side, a destination NAT would be used to forward the public IP to the private IP.  Conversely, if the internal server needs to access the public internet, a source NAT would overwrite the source IP with \*something\*.  This \*something\*, if configured to be the same public IP that is used for the destination NAT, would seem to be essentially a static NAT.  However, there are other options that can be inserted for \*something\*.  For example, you can insert the IP of the egress interface for all outbound traffic, or you can choose from a shared pool of public IPs.  My question, then, is about in which use case you would want to use the static NAT (with outbound traffic for the server using the same source address as inbound traffic) over the combined source / destination NAT (with outbound traffic using a shared source IP)?

In the past I would have set up RRAS with a public IP on a small public subnet which is routed through our boundary Firewall (Palo alto or in this instance Fortinet)

I have been unable to find anything on how this would be achieved in AWS.  I was thinking of using an elastic IP, but then I can’t see if that can be routed through our fortigate firewall or not? Ideally it would do this as all of our current edge gateway activity is via this firewall.

171,t3_gdlhd6,"TL;DR - Is it feasible to use ACLs to (partially) mitigate DDoS attacks assuming you have the bandwidth to withstand the attack? Obvious drawbacks?

Assumptions:

- eyeball network, no public servers or services

- need to protect shared (CGNAT) IPs

- 100G links to upstreams

- cutting down attacks so that less than 10G of mixed dirty/clean traffic is passed on is enough. 10G or less can be scrubbed with on-prem resources.



Basic approach when detecting attack is to automatically put up ACLs for the target IPs. For example like this:

- drop everything that isn't TCP. Gamers might complain, but grandma can still get to Facebook. Anybody not using ISP provided DNS servers can use DoH/DoT for the duration.

- drop incoming TCP SYN packets. Nobody is (supposedly) hosting anything critical on shared IPs.

- drop incoming TCP fragments, resets and packets to ports 0-1024

- drop all traffic from out of region RIR's /8s

- possibly whitelist some prefixes from major content providers. Depending on how large ACL lists you can support, kind of a reverse SIR approach



When the above fails, blackhole the target IPs upstream.

Theory: service degradation is better than no service. Hence cutting down on what the customers can access is an acceptable tradeoff, if it means withstanding the attack. Bonus points for being able to gather some information about the attacks and being able to complain to appropriate parties to cut down on the crap.

Background: new routers will have 100G interfaces. Instead of getting the usual 10G links, ordering 10G commits on 100G interfaces is a possibility, thus having ample headroom on top of normal traffic levels to deal with some DDoS attacks.

Disclaimer: I haven't built DDoS mitigation systems before, just plain firewalls. I currently don't have any DDoS attacks to deal with, so can't speak from experience.

I understand this might be a stupid idea, but from stupid ideas might come better ideas after generous application of clue stick.

Recently migrated over an NSA from a SonicWALL NSA 2600 to a Fortigate 300E. Migration went well, but an issue has cropped up in the past few days.

The SonicWALL (and now, Fortigate) has a bunch of IPSec VPN tunnels that all point to a windows server located on one of the subnets behind the NSA. Each tunnel has a separate virtual IP NATed to the internal IP of that server. These tunnels have a super specific purpose to send/recieve really small amounts of data to an EMR system and they have extremely low usage at any moment. They're all working, but the most data I've seen go through any of them in a single day is 100kb max. Not 100kb/s, 100kb over the course of a 24 hour period.  

Here's where the issue starts - since the migration, the server those tunnels point to regularly grinds to a halt throughout the day. Normally I'd be suspicious but literally no other servers in the environment are experiencing this, and it just so happens to be the one with all of these NAT IPs that the tunnels all point back to. I've run packet captures on these tunnels and there isn't really a whole lot going on at any moment yet the server grinds to a halt with all resources maxed out about 3-4 times a day. I've changed the SSL inspection rules and checked DPI but can anyone think of something that could be causing this?

I've run into an issue that's stumping me and my team.  Thought I might throw it out here in case someone had seen something similar.

We have two public IPs on an ASA where the HTTPS services behind those IPs are not reachable.  Other IPs in the same subnet on the ASA are working fine.  I've got a packet capture on the client machine and on the ASA.  The initial TCP handshake is failing with ""TCP ACKed unseen segment"".  The packets in the captures are lining up, so it doesn't look like anything is missed by the capture, but there is something weird in the TCP sequence numbers.

When the initial SYN packet leaves the client, it has TCP seq (raw) 3740762526 but in the capture on the ASA, it has seq 1413747879.  The packet goes on to the server and the ASA captures a SYN, ACK reply matching seq 141...  Then the client sees the reply with the same SEQ and ACK number that left the ASA, but these no longer match the original SYN packet on the client and thus the handshake fails.

Client ----- ASASEQ, ACK ----- SEQ, ACK3740762526, 0 -----&gt; 1413747879, 0820296656, 1413747880 &lt;----- 820296656, 1413747880

185,t3_gd66i5,"Okay so I don't fully understand some basic things about networking. This is how I think it works, at some point my understanding is gone.

I know I have one public IP address, every ping I send from my router, no matter if I use my ""Computer A"" or my ""Computer B"", will be seen as the same IP address, the public one. I hope I got this right.

Then, every device connected to that router, has a unique internal/local IP. I can ping Computer A from Computer B using its local IP as long as I'm under the same network.

My understanding starts to fall short there. If I have an ubuntu server in one machine and it has some LXD/LXC containers inside, I guess the host machine also works as a router, and all those containers are together in a local network. Pretty much like my ""real"" setup but all done virtually inside a single machine.

Some things are still easy if I set it up like this. I can use those LXD containers to access the internet, and I can run services from there, for example, I've been running a noip service inside a container and works nicely. I've also been running a couple bots inside containers and they also work nicely.

The issue comes when I try to connect to one of those machines from the internet.

If I host, let's say, a Minecraft server on a computer on my local network, I can give someone the public IP and the port and he can use it to connect to my computer. I don't quite know how is this done but I guess it's all about the port. My best guess is that only my machine is listening to that specific port, so any packet coming to my router gets to my computer. I don't fully understand this, but I know it works.

The thing is... How would I connect to a container inside a machine on my local network? As far as my understanding goes, the container would be listening at packets arriving to the specific port of its host machine, not to the router hosting the local network.

My understanding tells me that I need to point the packets to that specific machine instead of pointing them to the router. But since I only have one public IP, how do I do it?

There is something I don't quite understand because if I am not mistaken, when you ping a machine the ping has to go out and come back. And if I ping from the LXD container to the internet, the ping goes out and back in.

So there has to be a way to point for that specific machine from the exterior. But I don't understand.

Any explanation or link would be useful. Thanks.",How does one connect to an ubuntu container from the internet?,r/networking,0.57,1,8,{},0

I have been getting into Cisco networking and I'm attempting to emulate my work so I can do some labbing.  Got GNS3 all setup and it's working great doing with an ASA image with a couple of Routers.  So I decided to kick it up a notch and add 2 more routers to make my topology realistic.  Total 4 Routers + 1 ASA firewall.  yeah I thought my MBP was going to melt, the fan was blasting and it was too hot to even put it my lap, and the topology wouldn't stay up and kept going down.   So now I'm wondering, what kind of hardware would someone need to run 4-5 Routers and 1 FW...or possibly even 2 Firewalls?  I can't imaging once I start adding configs, it might become even more and more cpu-intesive.

When they are transferring a 1TB file they are hitting speeds around 1-1.5Gbps on the line according to interface statistics.

We have verified there is no interface errors, no discards, and the end to end path has negotiated to 100GB.

I asked them to adjust their TCP window size to ensure maximum throughput, to which they said “that’s not a thing.”  After pushing back they opened up a case with Microsoft who basically came back and said TCP Window is not adjustable on Server 2019 OS and that it scales the window size automatically to fill the pipe up.

I've confirmed I am able to publicly hit both from the internet, regardless of where I am, can access both on my smartphone for example, AND I can successfully access both via this healthcare org's PUBLIC wifi (seperate network).

But this healthcare org it seems to be timing out when navigating via https while on their wired and secure wifi network - the telnet port tests show connectivity over 443, but to me it seems like a TLS issue - their web browsers are showing ""Cannot connect to this site securely"". I don't have any control over this org but as far as their IE Security options go, they allow TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, but they're all grayed out due to GPO policy that I can't edit.

i'm here to ask help to identify the root cause of a FTTH connection that is acting very poorly to open files via SSL VPN.

Here the spec:

* 60 mbit up/down symmetic FTTH Connection. Is a business grade one with bandwidth reservation (600€/month)
* Zywall USG 210 Router Firewall.
* The server on i'm opening the files is a Windows 2016 file server VM, full patched, 4 core, 6 gb RAM.
* The infrastracture in new: 2 HP DL380 Gen10, 10 gbit networking between the 2 esxi host and principal switch

Previusly, we had a RDSL 15 mbit download and 3 mbit up at that site and opening a file took actually less time.

What i'm seeing: when i'm connected via SSL VPN (provided by the Zywall) to that server, if i try to open a 3 Mbyte excel file i get Excel freezing for about 10 second, then i see that excel is actually opening the file, i see the progress about at 15% increments, each one last about 3/4 second.

Total time to open a 3 mbyte file is about 40 second. This doesn't change if i use my workstation or another, or if i have Excel already opened or not.

What i've done until now:

* Tested bandwidth: i have a full 60 mbit down/60 mbit up with 2/3 msec ping from a speedtest
* I've adjust the MTU of the wan port to 1490, as i see it started to fragment at 1464 size and does not at 1462
* Running iperf from my home connection using VPN i get transfer speed about 12/15 Mbits. I have a 100/20 mbit connection at home and it was not loaded with other tasks at the moment (netflix,ecc)

I'm a sysadmin for a while now and I study hard to keep up and keep learning new things. I am by no means a networking expert. Today I ran into something that was really weird in my opinion. We host one of our domains at a Dutch supplier. We manually add and modify records and it's all fine. 

Because of some certificate issues in a webserver hosted at AWS, I was involved in that environment for the first time, and a colleague showed me around. Then, I noticed that they have multiple records for the same domain I host at my Dutch supplier, I only saw local records though.

206,t3_gby8gx,"I know what you're probably thinking - but hear me out.

Recently, a vendor ran two CAT6 links from an IDF inside the org (CAT5e patch panel) to a terminal outside the building to support network connectivity for a temporary structure we've put up.

I installed a 3750 (48x FE copper, x4 GE SFP) in the structure and configured it to trunk with a 6500 chassis which sits inside the IDF. When it came time to plug everything in, I found that the interfaces which were supposed to be trunking were actually in a notconnect state. The configs are super simple - no VLAN pruning or native VLAN bullshit. Just ""switchport mode trunk"" on both sides. So, I started looking at the hardware.

I swapped SFPs (tried multiple GLC-TE and GLC-T copper SFPs), tried multiple GE interfaces on the 3750 and 6500, swapped cables (CAT5e and CAT6), verified speed/duplex settings, etc. Nothing worked.

I finally yanked the trunk link from the GE interface of the 3750 and slapped it into a FE interface - and behold, it worked! Trunk was up, phones started registering, etc.

For the sake of troubleshooting, I swapped out the 3750 for a brand new 9300 and tried again. No dice. The trunk simply won't come up on a 1Gb interface.

I need the 1Gb uplink to support some bandwidth-hungry equipment which will sit in the temporary structure. I only have two copper lines, so the best I can do with a port channel is 200Mb/s on the 3750.

The vendor claims that they used CAT6 cables all the way through and terminated on a CAT5e patch panel in our IDF. I assume , but do not know, that the temporary structure (which was brought to us by a vendor and already has some cabling infrastructure) uses CAT5e at least, since they have their own gigabit switches which they offered to provide for us.

I want to create a three-point WiFi network with 50-100m in between each device. For now at least, may increase in range in the future. Planning on using three Ubiquity LocoM2 devices or something similar and provide wireless internet access. 

When clients connect to the said network they should get an IP address via DHCP but due to security concerns, I need to have them isolated from each other. 

Each client should seem like in different subnet and without possibility to scan or detect other devices connected to the same network.


The whole plan is like this:

* The network can be on 2.4GHz and/or 5GHz, dual-band will be excellent but for the initial testing only on 2.4GHz would suffice.
* Client devices must be isolated when connected.
* The AP's will have a full line of sight visibility, there will be no interference.
* Some bandwidth limit or burst limit, so one client couldn't take up full utilization of the link.
* Thinking about 10Mbit/s U/D for now, and around 20 clients on average.
* VPN connection for central monitoring and configuration.

Can the basics of guest zone/network suffice for this scenario?
I have to mention that I have limited experience with larger-scale wireless networks.

218,t3_gbhw8b,"Hi all, I've got two questions relating to data centre networking, firstly is if I've got our new re-design correct in my head and secondly following that plan we'll have an increased reliance on ACLs on our switches and I wanted to know if there's an easier GUI based way to manage ACLs.

Firstly, our current set up consists of an HA pair of firewalls doing all L3 in the DC, including all inter-VLAN traffic which is the main reason we want to move away from this set up. The firewalls have an internet breakout, WAN link DMZ and multiple other VLANs on them, prod, test, dev, voice, SQL etc. We currently manage rules between VLANs using the firewalls which have a decent GUI making it simpler to manage and harder to make mistakes. South of those firewalls is a pair of nexus 5k switches, 3 UCS chassis and a iSCSI SAN.

The problem with this is that there's only a 1gbps link between the nexus and the active firewall with all of the default gateways for our VLANs being sub interfaces on the 1gbps interface. Not a great design I know, we used to have a pair of 3925s doing our inter-VLAN routing with ACLs controlling traffic between VLANs. They were a bit of a pain to manage as there was only me at the time who had knowledge of working with them. Our MSP suggested those routers were unnecessary when they upgraded our firewalls (the previous ones only had 10/100 interfaces). We've grown a lot since the last upgrade though and are back in a position where we need to re-think things.

The plan is to use the Nexus switches for the inter-VLAN routing (they're currently only doing L2). Create a new small subnet between the Nexus switches and the firewalls and set the default route on the Nexus to point at the new firewall IP.  This plan takes all of the inter-VLAN traffic away from the firewalls, freeing them up to do what they were intended for. However, we lose the nice GUI based method for controlling our inter-vlan traffic and would be back to ACLs on the Nexus switches (something I'd like to avoid). Is there a solution that can help us manage the ACLs with a GUI and ideally where changes can be verified before being made? We use proper Cisco in our datacentre but are migrating to Meraki in our branches and their dashboard has spoilt me with how easy it is.

***April 9*** \- Everyone except for my IT-coworker and I are unable to RDP into their workstations. They can connect the VPN and ping their workstations, but get that ""Remote Desktop can't connect"" error (this never happened before). I also cannot RDP via VPN into any other workstations or servers on the network besides my own, which isn't configured any differently in RDP settings than any of the other machines.

Discovered that RemoteVPN-&gt;DNS setting is pointing to old decom'd DC, so I fixed the setting and am able to reach payroll server until HR person tried to RDP into it and then everyone was locked out again except myself to my own workstation.

***April 13*** \- Everyone's ability to RDP suddenly came back up, then dropped, then came back up again by the end of the day.

I discovered a No NAT rule that allows all trusted users access to all necessary internal VLANs, and the only ""deny"" ACLs I could find are blocking QUIC and ""hostile traffic"" which doesn't seem to have anything to do with RDP.

***April 21*** \- RDP stopped working again for office staff, so I did a packet capture while unsuccessfully trying to RDP into the payroll server:

Tried  ***sh cap asp | inc x.x.x.x*** (payroll server ip) which showed no drops from the firewall.

***April 22*** \- I noticed on the the Firewall Dashboard in ASDM that the workstations denying RDP access are listed at ""Top 10 Protected Servers under SYN Attack"" and sure enough, there are the ip addresses of the Business Officec computers plus the 3389 port #.

I then learned [this](https://layer77.net/2014/02/14/fixing-broken-microsoft-rdp-connections-through-a-cisco-asa-terminating-a-site-to-site-vpn/), and lowered the TCPMSS to 1300 and everyone's RDP started working again for almost a week ...

***April 28*** \- Discovered that the RemoteVPN-&gt;DNS setting keeps reverting back to the old decommissioned DC, so I sent this info to Cisco TAC.

***Yesterday*** \- the Business Manager and I were able to to RDP into everything, but other staff could not connect to their workstations.  I asked Cisco TAC if the ASA has some kind of DNS mapping in its config that's causing the VPN/DNS settings to revert, so they looked at my ""show tech"" and noticed that a firewall-object-network object had been configured linking the old DC to the ip address which now belongs to the new DC. So, I fixed that to point to the new DC.

The Business Manager lost her ability to RDP around 2pmEST, so I did a packet trace to her machine, and am waiting to hear back fro Cisco still, and there's a Zoom Board Meeting on Tuesday that's breathing down my neck ...

Secondly, support is awesome to have and there's no way to know everything about everything in this field and I honestly regret the critical tone of my title. Everywhere is a hot mess right now and I'm no exception ... 

I believe I may have isolated the issue - deep within an undocumented setting in the Content Filter, I found a tiny range of IP addresses with a ""full bypass"" in the VPN internal client subnet. I broadened the IP range a little, did a /release /flush /renew on my laptop, and now RDP works (for now?).

What are your thoughts on best practices on SNMP trap handling for routers and switches?

At my workplace we had a discussion and have 2 options:

1. Activate all snmp traps that are possible on each device and let the monitoring tool filter what events are important (and which ones should raise Incidents)

2. Activate just the snmp traps that are interesting for us (our configs differ a lot today. We would need to define templates for each device model)",SNMP trap handling best practices on routers,r/networking,0.63,2,2,{},0

Have 1Gbps business line from Comcast that we manage in our lab. Enterprise recommends we swap to the “enterprise lab infrastructure” that they manage.

The problem is the throughput is total crap compared to what we currently have.

Our lab ran internet connection is a Comcast 1Gbps business line. The enterprise one is supposedly a 1Gbps CenturyLink connection they route around over  their MPLS circuits in the same city but eventually hits the 1Gbps CL (at least that’s what I gather).

There shouldn’t be any issue to the “end user” between the two. I can understand some variance but the CL connection is a total dog for throughput in comparison to basically 95% of sites. Yeah you can pull up a browser and browse around but downloading any type of packages (OS packages, datasets, etc) it’s way slower than 90% of them.

We noticed it when updating our servers with drivers (like 400MB NVidia drivers) from Ubuntu mirrors. Our old connection could easily download this at 50-60MB/s (400-500Mbps) and be done in seconds. The new connection we get like 1-5MB/s (10-50Mbps).

After seeing this from multiples sources. I went and did some testing from vultr, AWS, FDCServers, Ramnode, DigitalOcean etc. Downloading files from those data centers in the same city (Seattle) on the old connection with 3-6ms pings we can get 80+MB/s. Most of them are 90+MB/s. The new connection varies from 8-12MB/s on one test from one of the providers and all the others are between 2-5MB/s (in seattle).

Running tests from different city’s LA, San Fran, Denver, ATL, Chicago, NYC, Washington DC. The Comcast connection slows down some depending on the distance but it’s routinely above 30MB/s on all of them. The new “enterprise” connection is between 1-2MB/s.

I ran the same tests on my home connection (Google Fiber) across the country (AL) to these same data centers in Seattle and get better speeds than this “enterprise” connection.

I’ve complained about it and enterprise just tells me “it’s the general internet” we can’t do anything. I’m like there HAS to be something wrong somewhere otherwise this thing is borderline useless. If it’s the “general internet” get CL to prove that because this thing is dog slow to _EVERY_ damn site. There is not a single site it’s even close on. Then they just tell us our TCP window size is too small or some shit when basically the same system 2 feet away is getting 80MB/s. 

I tested about 15-20 different sources spread across the country. And the comcast connection never had one below 10MB/s (100Mbps) even from ATL to Seattle or Washington DC to seattle. The new connection I think there was 1 or 2 that was 10-15MB/s the rest were in the 5MB/s even from Seattle.


Is there anything that you would want to see that would be hard to deny that there is a problem? Maybe it is the “general” internet being shit and CL is total shit in their peering or routing or whatever but is there anyway to prove that? Or am I just wrong and CL is just _that_ bad?

1) NO DUO.  This service is used by non-interactive batch processes.  No humans are controlling or initiating these sessions.  
2) We're NOT using IP addresses for authentication/authorization.  They're only used to decide whether we send notifications to tech contacts on the partner's account.  For instance, if there's a good login from an IP address the customer has registered with their account, we just add the login to an audit log.  If there's a good login from an unregistered IP address, we send the tech contact a notice (up to 4 per day).  If there's a bad login from a registered IP address, we just log the bad login, but lock the account and send an alert after 5 bad logins.  Bad logins from unregistered IP address cause the account to lock for bit and source IP address gets blocked for an hour.  If this happens for 3 times in a 24 hour period, we lock the account and send the partner a new username to use.

232,t3_gb5zma,"I have a bridge interface, and what I am trying to do is when I send ARP requests out of it (exiting eth0) I want the ""Sender IP address"" and ""Sender MAC address"" that is within ARP packet to change. I've tried for days with `arptables`, but I can't seem to figure it out. 

To illustrate what I mean, say I do this command to send an ARP request:

    nping --arp 10.99.99.99 -c 0 -e br0 --source-mac 11:22:33:44:55:FF --arp-sender-mac 11:22:33:44:55:FF --arp-sender-ip 10.1.1.1

This command sends the following across the network:

    Ethernet frame
    ---------------
    Src MAC:    11:22:33:44:55:FF
    Dst MAC:    FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
    
    ARP Packet
    ---------------
    Sender IP:  10.1.1.1
    Sender MAC: 11:22:33:44:55:FF
    Target IP:  10.99.99.99
    Target MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:00

So far, that's expected behavior. However, I'd like netfilter to change all the information. I can easily change the source MAC in the Ethernet frame as they leave eth0 with `ebtables`:

    ebtables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j snat --to-source FE:ED:FA:CE:BE:EF
    
Then I will see this in Wireshark:

    Ethernet frame
    ---------------
    Src MAC:    FE:ED:FA:CE:BE:EF
    Dst MAC:    FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
    
    ARP Packet
    ---------------
    Sender IP:  10.1.1.1
    Sender MAC: 11:22:33:44:55:FF
    Target IP:  10.99.99.99
    Target MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:00

Despite the ""Src MAC"" changing in the Ethernet frame, it's unchanged in the ARP packet. So, I try with `arptables` to change the Sender MAC and Sender IP to no avail. I've tried many variations of these commands with no effect:

    arptables -I OUTPUT -j mangle -o eth0 --mangle-ip-s 1.2.3.4
    arptables -I OUTPUT -j mangle -o eth0 --mangle-mac-s FE:ED:FA:CE:BE:EF
    arptables -I OUTPUT -o eth0 --opcode request -j mangle --mangle-ip-s 1.2.3.4

None of these will change any aspect of the ARP packet.

Due to the incorrect information within the ARP header, some ARP requests are not receiving responses. I did find some (but very few) resources online that accomplish exactly what I want.

I'm thinking about doing basically a ""ring"" of the DC switches (theyre in MLAG pairs) and then connecting the other DC from one/two pairs depending how many fibers we can get. OSPF or BGP in the underlay and EVPN overlay.

252,t3_gashhw,"Hi all,

I think i'm missing something silly here, but after setting up a site-to-site VPN between an SRX and an ASA, the phase 1 IKE (v2) comes up fine, but Phase 2 never does, nor does it even seem like its ever trying.

The story here is that SRX has replaced a Draytek, so the ASA has stayed the same and im sure the config is still fine on that.

Some details:

ASA local Subnet: [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24)

SRX local subnet: [192.168.2.0/24](https://192.168.2.0/24)

Originally I thought the issue was because the default VLAN 0 on the SRX was set to [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24) and was conflicting with the remote range on the ASA but ive changed this to [192.168.100.0/24](https://192.168.100.0/24) and still no dice.

I have a router connected to a switch which then has two trunks connecting to a pair of Nexus 3k switches. There is a VPC peer link between the Nexus, and the two connections to the switch are setup as LACP in a VPC group. I’d like to bring up an OSPF neighbor between the router and both Nexus for redundancy but I’m not sure how it will work. 

VPC peer routing is configured on the Nexus. My assumption was I can make a /29 and give each device an IP in that subnet and it should form neighbors with everything. My concern is making routing loops. Will this work at all?",OSPF over Nexus VPC,r/networking,0.92,10,16,{},0
254,t3_garwty,"Hey all,

I have a lab with a couple of servers, which is used to simulate and try out stuff. Networking part of it is basically two used L2 switches (Arista 7124SX and a Cat 3650). It's getting kind of convoluted, with \~20ish VLANs and no inter-VLAN routing at the moment. While this Arista is a L3 switch, this particular box does not support VRF routing (you can configure VRFs and assign interfaces to 'em, but routing between them is not happening). So, in order to tidy things up a bit, I'd like to plop in a VRF-capable L3 device (router on a stick), and spread out my VLANs into appropriate VRFs. Of course, this is a lab thing, so unsupported/EoL devices are okay (until something dies and I get threatening calls about why isn't the lab up, but I'll deal with that when I get there). So, the requirements are:

* Budget dictates it's going to be a used device (500-ish US$/Eur +- 20%)
* VRF-lite capable
* At least 1x10G interface for connecting to the existing topology, two would be excellent
* (Optional) Redundant AC power supplies

What I've been looking at:

* Cat 4948-10G w/ Enterprise services image
* ASR 1000 - way out of my budget from what I've been able to find
* ASR 900 series (920 would be great) - there aren't that many of those to be found used, and the prices are high

  I'm an enterprise type network admin, with about 10 years of industry experience and 10 more years before of regular IT related experience.

I can code, and if I get in a groove sometimes it's decent code.

  The reason I'm posting here, is I'm not sure what I should be looking for?  Is there a type of position that would benefit from a decent skill set in networking, and something that would allow growth of a programming skill set?

Anyway, at least some Internet streaming stations play just fine until about 22 minutes in where the other end suddenly closes the connection: a nice, graceful end with a FIN flag. This is very repeatable, and very frustrating.

Snooping with Wireshark shows there's some retransmissions, but well under 2%. Here's the kicker: Winamp is doing the same thing, and runs for hours. A previous version of this player I built also will play the exact same stations for hours, and for the most part running the same firmware.

We also got it to work by removing the configuration from the client NIC (and keeping the configuration on the dock station NIC) which complicates things since not all clients are using this type of Dock station and it would be near to impossible to keep apart in the GPO Dot1x settings.

Both generals are aware of the strategy they will be using, because in a real world scenario where the generals are the client and the server, the developer creates both.

So, as far as I know, the two general's problem is all about sending acknowledgements to acknowledgements without knowing when to stop, because the one general may not receive the last acknowledgement and won't send his army, because he doesn't know if the other general received the previous one. so instead of stopping, the generals can say that if they manage to maintain an acknowledgement sending rate of approximately one acknowledgement per second for the hour that is one hour before the attack time. I say approximately because if the last acknowledgement is not recieved and the rate is 1 acknowledgement 1.000277778, the generals should still attack. How approximately ? approximately enough for the last acknowledgement to be allowed not to happen, but not enough for the last two to be allowed not to happen. So about a 1 / 3600 seconds tolerance.

first post, hooray! If I break any rules or am not conforming to the netiquette of this community please accept my apologies.

**TL;DR Do you know a (24/16/8 port) switch with 802.3bt power envelope for each individual port?**

This is question comes after a brainstorming session regarding setting up bold remote (rural) computer classrooms. Because Rural schools have limited access to IT technology and electrical energy.

To tackle the challenge of IT technology a modular low power computer system with custom OS was created by volunteers.

Some information regarding our project can be found by googling"" educaid KUBO toolkit"".

Since setting up these systems in our 2 pilots we have noticed the frustration of the second limitation being affordable and reliable access to energy.

The idea now is to use a PoE switch that can deliver next to data also energy to the low power computer systems. How this switch is going to be powered is another question with another technical background not to be discussed here.

Because the combination of a monitor and the low power computer system consumes an easy 30Watt the 802.3af and 802.3at standards do not make the cut.

802.3bt with its 51W to 60W power envelope will suffice for our project needs (computer systems, monitor, lights, fans,…)

Upon researching the necessary primary building block, being a 802.3bt switch the plethora of vendors and models were reviewed. And here it is where we could use your expertise. From research there are no 24/16/8 port switches that provide the 51-60W power envelope to each port.

Some examples:

Vendor A has a 24 port switch with only 8 ports 802.3bt enabled and the rest is 802.3af.

Vendor B has a 16 port switch which are all 802.3bt but has a total capacity of 300Watt (300 / 16 = 19 Watt per port, not enough)

Because there are so many models and so many vendors, I am wondering if the community knows of a model or a vendor that has a 24/16/8 (we aren’t fussy) port switch which has 802.3bt (50Watt) available power for each port?

We're looking to add 10Gbe capability to our half rack and I was hoping for some recommendations for a pair of Top of Rack switches.

We have a half rack at a colocation facility, with 4 hypervisors, 1 NAS with 4 x 1Gbe RJ45, a new NAS with 6 x SFP+ 10Gbe ports, and a pfsense XG-7100 appliance with 2 SFP+ 10Gbe ports.

Each hypervisor has 4 x 1Gbe ports, and we intend to buy SFP+ 10Gbe PCIe cards for the hypervisors, at least 2 ports per hypervisor.

Our current switches are 48 port RJ45 1Gbe Cisco 2960-S switches stacked.  The model we have has 4 x SFP 1Gbe uplink ports, so we don't have any SFP+ 10Gbe switch ports.

We don't need fancy features but L3 capability is a must (we'd like to be able to give the switch an IP on each VLAN) and we'd like to have 2 switches for redundancy.  The assumption is all recommendations have some link aggregation, DHCP relay / proxy.

Our intent is to continue using the Cisco switches for a little while as we won't be able to get into the colo to rewire everything.  So what we want are switches with plenty of SFP+ 10G and 1Gbe ports.

I'm also curious as I read that some switches support both 10G/25G.  Are such SFP ports compatible with adapters that only support SFP+ 10Gbe?

Budget wise, we'd like to get the best bang for buck possible but need reliable workhorses that will last many many years - I'd say $2-5k max per switch is within our budget, so $10k for the switches alone.  Assume we have a totally separate budget for the transceiver modules.

First of all, I'm using Ruckus (brocade) switches, mainly 7450 and 7250 on SPR code.

I have two properties connected by layer 2 Fiber. It's two links in a port channel (link aggregate group) operating at 20gig.

We want to introduce a backup layer 2 connection. However, it's a much slower (300M) point to point wireless connection.

I know that I can't just add the point to point to the LAG because the speed of the whole lag will be limited to the speed of the point to point.

I've been researching using spanning tree for redundancy, but I'm not really sure how that works.

Basically I want it to work like this:
1) Use the fiber lag always if the link is up.
2) If one fiber link goes down, the LAG will still be up, we'll just operate at 10gig instead of 20gig.
3) If both fiber links (the whole LAG) is down, use the slower point to point

I am having some problems with setting up the VTI configs between my 2 routers (R1 and R3)  


IPsec phase 1 and 2 comes up everything works like a charm.  


However, the whole reason we use VTI for is that we can have separate policies between encrypted and un-encrypted traffic.  


So my problem is:  


I wrote the following Policies (One for the VTI interface and one for the physical interface):  


R3:  
conf t

!  
class-map match-all VTI-CLASS 

 match any

 exit

policy-map VTI-MAP

 class VTI-CLASS

 set precedence 2

 exit

interface tunnel1

 service-policy output VTI-MAP

 exit

!

!

class-map match-all Physical-CLASS

 match any

 exit

policy-map Physical-MAP

 class Physical-CLASS

 set precedence 4

 exit

interface ethernet1/0

 service-policy output Physical-MAP

 exit

!  


\---------------------------------------------------------------------  


I have done a packet capture in wireshark and I see that every single traffic leaving the router (R3) is having  the QoS value ""Precedence 4""  


But packets going through the VTI tunnel interface also have ""precedence 4"" QoS markings (But it supposed to be having ""precedence 2"" markings.  


As soon as I give out:  
**interface ethernet1/0**  
**no service-policy output Physical-MAP**  
 **exit**  
!

So basicly removing the physical policy, traffic going through the VTI tunnel instantly turns into ""precedence 2"" marked QoS values.  


But for some reason, if both policies are applied the physical interface policy simply overwrites the VTI tunnel policy.  


  
\--------------------------

Just to buy some time I will also post my Ipsec config aswell: (Which is mirrored in both routers):

I read reddit all the time for help on issues, but I rarely post, but I'm at a stopping point.  I really need help and google/reddit/everything else aren't doing anything.

A couple of years ago I migrated our corporate environment from an ASA 5510 to a Cisco Firepower 2110 with FMC.  We've always used Anyconnect as the client obviously.  I run a couple of Mac's, (and am the only user in the company that does, the rest of my IT Team use Windows), and Anyconnect has run flawlessly for years.  Yesterday, during the middle of a VMware migration, (we setup a new VMware cluster and installation and I was migrating all the VM's from the old hosts to the new), I plugged my Macbook into my wired connection and my connection through the VPN went screwy.  I all of a sudden could not access my ILO screen's, the VMware host screen's or any other intranet site at work, (FMC, Cisco Wireless Controller, Sharepoint, our time and attendance, etc).  Regular internet traffic was still working.  Obviously, I checked the status of the Anyconnect client, (it had reconnected).

I began really testing this, so, as stated above I connect with IP addresses, not hostnames for VMware, so, I assumed this was not a DNS issue, but still tested that.  I can ping everything, via IP address or hostname.  It all works.  I can RDP across Anyconnect, (which is how I finished the migration btw), I can telnet and SSH to all devices, including my VMware ESX systems.  I can browse to the intranet to a non port 80 or 443 address through a web-browser, (i.e. the vSphere Server Appliance configuration page is at [https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5480](https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5480) and that works flawlessly).

So, everything works, except port 80 and 443 from ANY WEB BROWSER.  I tried Safari, Edge Chromium, Google Chrome, Firefox, I even installed Tor and that didn't work.  

If I do a portscan on one of my devices, 80 and 443 show as open.

If I run my windows 10 VM on Parallels, and connect through the Anyconnect VPN, it works fine.  My other Mac works fine, this is clearly a problem with my primary Mac only.

Things I have done:

A) Create a new location in network preferences

B) Checked the routing tables, (though, everything else works, why would this not be right?)

C) Delete and re-add Wifi

D) Delete NetworkInterfaces.plist, com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist,   
com.apple.airport.preference.plist, preferences.plist

E) Uninstall and re-install Anyconnect.  Also, remove the Anyconnect configuration files, and profile   
files.  I have tried various versions of this step over and over.

F) Rebooted a million times

G) Googled.  Alot.

Again the action that caused this was simply plugging an ethernet cable in while I was connected to the VPN over WiFi.  

Any suggestions?

My good friend and fellow Network Admin/Manager suggested I wipe and start over with the Mac.  Well, with the whole work from home thing, my time machine backups are not current.  Also, WHY is that always a solution?  I have thought about calling Cisco and/or Apple, but I have a feeling they will point at each other and not help.

However, it seems to me that if you're using top-of-rack switches in the access layer, the L1 infrastructure required would get a bit out of control...

If we're looking at a medium-to-large sized DC, wouldn't it make more sense to design a 3-tier model where every TOR switch connects to 2+ EOR switches, and then those EOR switches connect to all the core switches in the Clos Fabric? You could still scale-out at the access layer installing additional EOR switches if needed.

If what I'm saying DOES make sense, then why isn't this sort of design commonly depicted? I mean, I know not every deployment will use managed TOR switches; some will have EOR only, others will have FEX (though isn't Cisco sunsetting it?), but my impression has always been that TOR tends to be the preferred design choice these days, at least in pods where do you don't have a bunch of large blade servers.",Top-of-Rack Access in Spine-Leaf DC designs,r/networking,0.69,8,12,{},0

335,t3_g7j5o2,"This is both a real situation and a hypothetical question, I want to understand what my upstream provider is doing (or could be doing).

I buy transit off AS2, who buys transit off AS3, who peer or buy transit off AS4. Everything is simple, my routes are redistributed.

Now I bring up a connection to an IX and peer with the route servers. AS3 is already a member of this IX.

    +-----+         +-----+         +-----+         +-----+
    | AS1 +---------+ AS2 +---------+ AS3 +---------+ AS4 |

       +-------------+ IX +------------+
                     +----+

AS3 now learns my routes from the IX with a shorter AS path, and if they accept them it would mean I get 10gbps to AS4 rather than the 100mbps I'm paying for. This obviously isn't the case, but I want to understand what they're doing to mitigate this.

If AS3 had a manually managed list of routes that they were meant to be accepting from AS2, and say marked them with a community string when they learned them, then redistributed to AS4 based off that community string - The route that's now in their RIB is learned from the IX and does not have that string attached, so the moment the IX route lands in their RIB they'll stop redistributing the prefix to AS4. 

If they did this redistribution based off manually/API managed prefix lists egress to AS4, and my route was on that list, then they would redistribute my IX route and I would end up with 10gbps of bandwidth to AS4, when I'm only paying for 100mbps of transit to AS2 who also only pays for 100mbps of transit to AS3.

The only conclusion I've been able to come to is that AS3 must simply set a higher local preference for routes learned from paying customers. But that almost seems too simple, and doesn't cover off another issue;

Say I advertsied a /22 into transit and /24s into the IX. AS3 now redistributes the /22 it learns from AS2 to AS4, but when traffic reaches AS3 it would surely follow the more specific /24 routes to me via the IX.

So, within my EVPN fabric HMM works just fine, the VM pops up on a new VTEP the old MAC route is removed and the new one is added and traffic flows just fine. I'm having a problem regarding a VIP attached to 2 different hosts, HostA and HostB. HostA is in DC1 and HostB is in DC2.

HostA has an IP of [10.1.1.101](https://10.1.1.101) a MAC of 0000.1111.2222, HostB has an IP of [10.1.1.102](https://10.1.1.102) a MAC of 0000.2222.3333. The VIP is [10.1.1.100](https://10.1.1.100). When the VIP moves between hosts the l2vpn route gets added, but the old one stays in the BGP table. This makes sense since it's a different MAC address, but because of this the traffic to that VIP gets blackholed in the site that no longer has that VIP. That site still thinks that the route is local, and will continue to think that until it's finally removed from the BGP route table. I think that happens when the ARP entry times out on the old VTEP, but I'm not certain.

Currently my cEdge has 3 ports built:

G0/0/0 - VPN0 is direct to the internet

G0/0/1 - VPN1420 that connects directly to my Metro-Ethernet and my legacy sites

G0/0/2 - VPN1420 that connects to the corporate LAN

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I can have a vEdge on the color public-internet and it works great, but I want to bring in SD-WAN into the metro-ethernet, but I can never get away from having a few sites that will always be legacy.  Or at least for a few years.

So, I need to add a G0/0/3 - VPN0 that connects back into the LAN and can listen for TLOC from the metro-ethernet.

But this is where I am lost.

The picture I have with the hybrid is close to what I am trying to do, but not exact.   On that one, they have VPN0's reversed for what I am trying to do.  I already have legacy on G0/0/1.

My thought process here is to add a /30 from G0/0/3 to my switching core network, advertise it in OSPF, so that it will be reachable from anywhere, even my metro-ethernet. Then when I add a SD-WAN site. give it an IP address on the legacy metro-ethernet, and then it should be able to make a connection to the other side because they would be able to find each other and have the same color?

351,t3_g70bnc,"Hello,

Here is my scenario...

We have a medium sized private data center, this site is connected to the internet through a single ISP provider. This ISP gives us a block of IPs we use to publish various services to the internet (Exchange, Lync, VPN, Citrix, and our LOB applications).

**Couple of internet outages go by and I am now pressed to find a redundant solution so that our site does not go dark when our ISP has an issue.**

Searching around I keep ending up at SD-WAN solutions ([bigleaf.net](https://bigleaf.net), [aryaka.com](https://aryaka.com), [zscalar.com](https://zscalar.com) [catonetworks.com](https://catonetworks.com), etc..) but I know very little about SD-WAN and it seems to be there are different types of SD-WAN providers (on-premise, cloud, backbone etc.).

I can get internet services from a 2nd ISP provider so that we have **redundant ISP providers**, this would ensure the last mile is also redundant and protect us against local line cuts.

I would need to be able to ""bond"" both ISPs together in a fail-over configuration and it seems SD-WAN can do this for **outbound** traffic.

**What I can't wrap my head around is how the IP addressing is handled. If I have 2 different ISPs and 2 different set of IP addresses, how is the IP switching handled?**

For example if Exchange's autodiscover DNS records are configured to resolve to IP from primary ISP, the secondary ISP IPs will be different. How can Exchange continue to work? This is just one example of the many other apps users need access to by IP or DNS.

I did came across BigLeaf ([https://www.bigleaf.net/same-ip-address-failover/](https://www.bigleaf.net/same-ip-address-failover/))  and they market themselves as a SD-WAN provider, and on that page it seems to provide a solution to the exactly problem we are trying to solve.

*Because with Bigleaf, when one of your Internet circuits has an outage, you don’t. Your IP address doesn’t change. Your VPN, remote desktop session, SSH session, VoIP call, Web Presentation, and every other application stays up!*

So it sounds to be that some SD-WAN providers are able to provide a solution to our question.

Anyone have experience using SD-WAN solutions to provide both inbound and outbound fail-over and address our ""same-ip-address-failover"" requirement? I would like to come up with a short list of providers to reach out to for further discussions etc.

In case anyone suggests, I know we can keep the TTL on our critical DNS records low and update the IP addresses in case of outage, but this is not what we want. Looking for an automated and seamless solution.

Thanks for your help.

I mean, I've done troubleshooting and small projects in DC environments, but I've never actually re-engineered one or stood one up from scratch. With this in mind, I've worked for 3 companies and each of them had data centers that looked like this: 

* Corporate LAN &amp; WAN connect directly to the DC core.
* Most VLANs are open and reside on the Core.
* Stateless ACLs are sometimes applied for certain environments at the VLAN-interface level.
* Everything public-facing is put into a DMZ with its own switches &amp; hosts, with all VLANs being trunked up to an NGFW at the internet edge.

It seems to me that the idea of putting only public services into a DMZ while leaving everything else more-or-less open on the internal network is, well, a bit antiquated. After all, internal users &amp; devices can be malicious too. With this in mind, are we at the point where it makes sense to abandon the traditional DMZ concept and, instead, segment the entire data center from the rest of the corporate network? Are companies actually doing this? Or do most of them still having architectures looking very much like my previous 3 employers?

Hi, I am a beginner in fiber optical networking, actually to whole networking. Basically, I am trying to create a working LAN topology, I used 24 core F/O and distribute them to access switches with SFP and I used a patch panel to manage F/O cables (on left). While I was trying to communicate them with each other, I get confused about the termination box, panel, switching part. Should I place a switch near to the patch panel and connect them together to make a working LAN? If I should, should I connect all access switches to that switch? I got two more floors that I should carry the cores. While thinking physically I don't understand how can I just take one cable with a bunch of cores and carry it along the other floors efficiently.

Hope you all are staying safe and keeping busy during the epidemic.

I am currently attempting to troubleshoot an issue with some Cisco 8811 IP Phones not recording their calls.

We have three remote users that are using Cisco 8811 IP Phones connected via the built in VPN client on the phone to a Cisco ASA. I have verified that the call recording server as well as the other collab servers are able to connect to the 8811 phones over the VPN, so network reachability is not an issue here. 

The 7841 and 8811 are setup identically on the CUCM with the exception of the additional VPN configuration for the phones. Otherwise everything else is setup exactly the same for the users and phones on all the other servers.

*&gt;cp &lt;capture\_name&gt; /ngfw/var/common/*

&amp;#x200B;

Now in FMC, go to the 'Troubleshoot' button for the FTD in question, then 'Advanced Troubleshooting' and the first tab 'File Download' you can type in the filename of the capture to download.

392,t3_g5zydj,"Hi Guys  
(quick overview of network)

  
2 WAN lines from a main and backup ISP run into a Fortigate80E firewall. The firewall is directly connected to a  UBNT gigabit layer 3 EdgeSwitch 48-Port EdgeSwitch which handles core switching and does have L3 capabilities. This switch then connects out to 11 smaller access switches that go out to banks of desks. The company has roughly 150 users atm and will reach 200 by the end of the year. There are no on prem servers and almost all traffic will be voip, web browsing and accessing files off cloud storage. We also have about 10 unifi pro AP's and 2 cloud keys that manage wireless networking. 

  
My manager has requested I look into replacing our current Fortigate80E firewall with an offering from Ubiquiti. (The current firewall isn't under enormous stress, this is more for future-proofing project and hopefully being able to centralise management around a ubiquiti console)

  
My first thought is seemingly the most powerful firewall offering from Ubiquiti is the USG Pro 4? However, from what I have read it doesn't seem more capable than a Fortigate 80E? maybe more of a sidestep, besides the obvious advantage of centralized management with the current switch and ap's.  
I was also thinking for a company of this size, surely it would be better to have a separate firewall and router to deal with core routing. Perhaps a USG Pro as the firewall and maybe another Ubiquiti router to handle the majority of internal routing??

398,t3_g5odss,"Hello, fellow networking admins and engineers,  

I have a stumper of a situation that we have had for a year or so now since we rolled out Windows 10 to everyone.  The symptoms we see are users in remote offices are reauthenticating repeatedly over and over with our Network Access and Control system (Cisco ISE using Aruba RAP-109 WAPs).  The logs in ISE say ""supplicant stopped responding to ISE.""  We also had Aruba's ClearPass authentication server (a direct competitor of Cisco ISE) being used and it had the same problems as well.  

This issue has gone on for over a year with ARUBA, CISCO, and MICROSOFT TAC teams being involved with none of them finding anything wrong or anything to show them from the infrastructure/client-side.  This is still happening and today we received a trouble ticket from a site that has operated fine for years saying ""All the users in the office are having problems connecting to the Wi-Fi (which actually translated into only one user is sitting in the office....am I right? - I was right). But none the less, this typically happens randomly and affects most if not all of the entire office.  We have swapped out laptops, we have swapped out access points.   we have upgraded, downgraded just about everything on the infrastructure side with no new results and the problem continues. 

So I got to thinking, a commonality I found (so far) is these sites having issues are all multi-tenant buildings.  That led me to think, hey - there might be other corporate Wi-Fi systems in the area that are ""de-authenticating"" our clients from our Wi-Fi network. When a trouble ticket was reported, we always found a fair amount of SSIDs around that can be seen from the user's laptop.  I'm guessing maybe they have a wIPS solution running and think we have unauthorized endpoints trying to connect to rogue WAPs.  Just grasping at straws on this one.  And this theory doesn't support the fact that this issue became very noticeable when all the windows 10 clients were being issued out and were never seen on the windows 7 clients. But I'm still latched onto the wIPS de-authentication possibility because that bought us some time with management harping at us with status and progress updates and seemed to calm them down just a tad when I threw this scenario at them as a possibility we need to investigate.    I also thew out solar flares and EMP mishaps occurring nearby.  Nobody bought it.  

The guys managing the laptops are blaming the network (of course).  We tell them that we can't force the laptop to stop its 802.1x authentication process midstream.  Cisco, Aruba, and MICROSOFT can't find anything.  We don't have any tools or technical staff at the remote sites and since the devices can't connect to the network, we can't troubleshoot.  We did put these trouble sites into monitor only mode within the ISE appliances so they can connect.  We still see NAC/802.1X auth failing, but at least they can do some work and connect with the network until InfoSec says to turn it back on and fix whatever it is causing NAC to fail.

I just wanted to share this scenario with everyone to see if anyone else has any similar experiences or guidance on the topic.  Everyone likes a good challenge and this has been the best one yet, at least for our networking team.

I need to add a router to existing subnets that will provide failover between 2 ISPs with floating routes and IP SLA.

I am trying to wrap my head around certificate authentication.

I have a Cisco Anyconnect VPN setup using IKEv2, AAA and certificate setup as authentication method.

Device certificate on OUTSIDE interface is by 3rd party trusted cert authority and I have their identity certificate, and couple of root CA’s under CA Certificates in ASA.

Internal PKI infrastructure and its root ca is loaded under CA Certificates which is used for user cert validation. Users have user certs install on their laptops from internal PKI.

In the scenario above if user present’s 3rd party trusted user cert could they successfully pass validation?

Is there a way to specify which trustpoint is used for certificate validation?

Edit:

the solution to the problem is to add **no validation-usage** to the trustpoint.

You can also do this from ASDM by editing the cert under CA Certificates and under advanced deselect validation usage options.

Look up validation option in the document below

427,t3_g4y4qe,"Hi /r/networking,

Just returned from a small business site that I have recently just taken on. Unfortunately, not much was handed over in terms of setup information so today has been much of an information gathering exercise. The reason I have been called out is they currently have no internet access. This wasn't an issue until it was 3 weeks ago. As far as I am aware, nothing was changed. They have quite a basic L3 setup as follows:

Core Switch &lt;---&gt; Lightspeed Filtering System &lt;---&gt; Cisco ASA &lt;---&gt; Cisco Router &lt;---&gt; Internet

I have been informed that Lightspeed system was never set up when installed so pretty much a redundant box that resides in the cabinet at the moment. NAT is carried out on the Cisco ASA. The internal IP address scheme is 10.1.20.0/24 with the inside interface on the Cisco ASA set on Gig1/8 to 10.1.20.254. The outside scheme is ""showing"" as 192.168.1.0/24 (I say ""showing"" as I don't think this is correct but I will get to that) with the Gig1/1 interface on the Cisco ASA set to outside with the IP address as 192.168.1.1. Now, I only have administrative control up until the Cisco ASA as the Cisco router was provided and is administered by BT Business, apparently. I have no details for this and no management access without doing a full factory reset. The site has two physical hosts that contain two virtual DC's that provision DNS, DHCP etc. They have four switches that are trunked via fiber to give a 10GbE backbone. I have thoroughly tested the internal network on a multitude of ports just as a precaution and to completely rule it out and devices are getting valid internal IP addresses and can inter-communicate.  I think this was apparent from the get go and the problem lies outside the internal network. Gave BT a call to make sure they had no issues on their end which they confirmed (typical). 

Now, this brings me to the NAT setup, which I believe is what is causing the issue. Fortunately, due to lockdown, only 2 members of staff are present on site that require internet access so as a temporary workaround, I have patched them into a few of the spare ports directly on the Cisco router which I CAN get internet access but only on the 192.168.*.* range, so at the moment they can't access anything internally but they are fine with that for now as they just need access to emails and internet based communication tools. This is where I think the potential problem lies. As I was patching these devices in, I assume the Cisco router is handling DHCP which is giving out a 192.168.128.0/24 address scheme which does not reside within the same subnet as what is set on Cisco ASA outside interface, with an IP 192.168.1.1. My question would be, would it be just a case of setting the outside interface on the Cisco ASA to an IP that resides within the 192.168.128.0/24 range, presumably 192.168.128.1 then set up a static route so that the two devices can communicate?

436,t3_g4qdns,"Good day everybody. 

This one is long.
TL;DR - I am redoing the Wi-Fi at my work, currently there is home routers acting as access points all joined together with 100 down and 6 Modem providing it all. Looking for input how to replace it equipment that can handle the load of 300+ people at peak times. 

I was going back and forth between homenetworking and networking to make sure I am in the correct sub but with how big my setup has to be I assume I would end up in this one. I will try to include as much info as possible. 

I have dabbled with enterprise gear for my home lab but haven’t done a full setup for a commercial environment before. 

My situation - I am in the navy stationed in guam and I have been designated for redoing the public Wi-Fi through out certain locations in the ship. There is roughly 300 users that will be on it during the peak hours. 

How it is setup currently (You might chuckle a bit):

It starts with a 100 Down 6 Up Cable modem (Highest speed offered on the island) with a Linksys EA9400 Home Router that has two Cat 5E Cables coming out of the LAN Ports. This is in a public office space and Game Room. This sees about 35 people max. 

The first CAT 5E cable goes from that router to a AC1700 TP-Link C20 home router in the gym a level below. This space sees about 25 People max

The second CAT5E cable makes a long 400+ feet run to a large eating area (Mess Decks) where roughly 250 people at one time can sit and eat. That cable plugs into another AC1700 TP-Link C20. That router in the eating area then has three more CAT5E cables from it.

The first cable runs another home C20 Router in a Lounge area. About 20 people will be in the space. The second cables goes to a Linksys EA7300 and that is in a officer eating area (Ward Room). This one will be going away soon since the officers are going to get a second modem for themselves. The third cable goes to nowhere and is assumed dead. (Tracking it down tomorrow) 

To top it off, there is a random Wi-Fi booster attached to router in the public eating area (Mess Decks). No idea who is using it. 

So my plan is to start from scratch. Whatever purchase plan for equipment will have to be presented to my commanding officer to get approval for purchase.

Since this will be a Wi-Fi only network, I will be relocating the Modem, Router, and Switch to help get even distribution of the new Ethernet cable.

As for new equipment, I was considering a Ubiquiti setup. I just trying to plan for when I detach from this ship and future growth for the network. 

Edgerouter X (ER-X-US)
Unifi Switch 8 60Watt (US-8-60W)
5x AP-AC Lite (UAP-AC-LITE) 

Every public space will get 1 AP with the large eating area 2. One for each side of the room. 

I hope I didn’t cause too much a headache asking for help. I am no means a professional and my local IT’s are just providing new cable and tools since most don’t know as much as myself (I am mechanic at work, Nerd at home)

Today, most of our devices still only speak SNMP, which is by no means a modern nor real time monitoring protocol. Most NMS only support 5 minute polling, while some support 1 minute polling intervals. I am looking for something that can do at least per minute polling.  

These devices also respond to ICMP ping requests. Most of these machines can respond to a ping per second, so graphing this data would be beneficial. Not sure per second pings would cause a spike in traffic or cpu resources.

Overtime, more and more of our networking equipment will support some sort of streaming telemetry.Today, we have both Juniper and Cisco devices that support streaming telemetry. Juniper supports streaming with their Junos Telemetry Interface (JTI). Cisco has their Model-Driven Telemetry. I cannot find many NMS that seem to support either of these protocols. 

The last metric we would like to monitor is flows. Our Juniper devices support IPFIX and many of our switches support sFLOW. I am not sure that the default flow interval is on most of these type of devices, but I assume it's per second type of reporting?

I assume most will just recommend we use some sort of opensouce system, and make our own. The TICK stack, ELK, and prometheus come to mind. This seems to be the default option, especially for the streaming telemetry use case. 

However, we really don’t have an interest in rolling our own. I like the look of Grafana and Kibanna for visualizations, but sorting through thousands of MIBs, OIDs, streaming telemetry events, and other data, and then creating our own dashboards sounds like a ton of work.

I am currently working on a script to replace ACLs on Cisco IOS/IOS-XE routers. Atomic config changes beyond a single line and netconf candidate configs are not a thing on the firmwares of many of the devices that I have to work with.

My assumptions are:

- Someday someone, who doesn't know what the script does exactly, will try to do replace an ACL on all of our routers and the script should not fuck up everything unless the other assumptions are met.
- The ACL that needs to be changed might be somewhere where it might influence my ability to log in. e.g. it is the ACL on the interface over which I am logging in or it might be the ACL used for the SSH access.
- If the old ACL allows me to login in then the new one will also allow this.
- Errors need to be recoverable, e.g. if I lose the connection for whatever reason I can run the script again and bring everything into the desired state.

Here are some Ideas that I had, which do not work:

- resequence the old ACL so that there is enough ""space"" for the new one entries to be inserted before the old entries. Then delete the old entries. This does not work because you can not have the same entry multiple times in an ACL. Also the resequence is only available for legacy IP.

- copy the ACL, change all sections in which that ACL is used to the copy, change the ACL in place, revert the changes to the config so that the new ACL is used. Delete the copy. This has several Problems:
  - How do you know where the ACL is used? There are many more things than interfaces and vtys.
  - Error recovery is a pain in the butt because you have to check if a copy exists, then you have 2 ACLs on the device, one of which might not be complete but you dont know which one that is. Also you might have a config that references both sections. You might be able to resolve some of that, but it will be painfull.

Something else  I thought about was adding the IP from which I am logging in as the first entry to the ACL so that I can not lock me out.
But I have to take a deeper look at some of the usecases of ACLs because if an ACL is used in some kind of inverted fashion that might also lock me out.

Would I need to be using NAT/PAT? And Can I have two outside interfaces? Are the links e0/3 between routers in each AS even necessary? My worry was what if say e0/1 on R3 went down while R3 is the active router...HSRP has some way to tell if that happens and make a switch right?

Trying to do RPKI validation properly on my network. Thought I was fully compliant, but with Cloudflares new testing tool, discovered I'm missing something here and not sure how to work around it.

https://i.imgur.com/tlvxG9p.png

On my ASR9001, its default table is just internet, I manage it fully with OOB interface. It has rpki servers configured to communicate out the management interface, but populates the data properly into the BGP table. I then have it signal via iBGP to the neighboring 9006.

On the 9006, internet is in its own vrf while connecting to transit and peers. It gets the iBGP signals for RPKI from the 9001. However this data appears to only apply to the 9001's routes, not the 9006's, as the 9006's routes show ""not-known"" for RPKI status. I will have ""not-valid"" or ""valid"" next to ""not-known"" on the 9006 due to this for the same netblock.

So I assume what I need is the 9006 connected and talking to my RPKI servers. However with internet in a vrf, this seems impossible as I can only configure rpki-server functions on the default table on its routes (which are all management table routes anyway for private space).

459,t3_g3qz9z,"Hello, I'm at my wits end trying to figure out what is wrong with the commands I am using.

I have two hosts, [172.22.19.48](https://172.22.19.48) &amp; [172.22.19.176](https://172.22.19.176) (behind closest routers Gi0/1 interface) , These are the only hosts that are allowed to reach an FTP server ([172.25.30.15](https://172.25.30.15)) two routers away.

On the closest router to the source, I'm using an extended ACL.

The goal is to allow only those two hosts access to the FTP while their entire subnet can access the DNS server (172.22.23.39)

`(config)# ip access-list extended MultiHosts`

`(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp` [`172.22.19.48`](https://172.22.19.48) [`0.0.0.128`](https://0.0.0.128) `host` [`172.25.30.15`](https://172.25.30.15) `eq 21`

The second line uses the WM [0.0.0.128](https://0.0.0.128) to ensure both hosts are allowed trough and none else.

The third line uses a WM of [0.0.3.255](https://0.0.3.255) to ensure the entire subnet can reach the destination.

461,t3_g3hr79,"Hey All,

I'll be performing my first collapsed core shutdown in my career. It's a hybrid campus and datacenter mix in a small/mid environment with netapp, ucs, vmware stack.. I wanted to reach out to see what advice the community would recommend on things/issues to watch out for during a shutdown while replacing the  L2/L3 core and start up. Leaning on the experience of the community would really help me out me a lot, especially while the network is so critical during a COVID-19 world we live in today.

I'm the only senior member of my team with the knowledge of all systems to be able to perform this maintenance window and I don't have a change control and/or peer review partner to lean on at the moment with some of my team/head counts not being filled at the moment which has put a lot of workload on me, which to be honest made me learn a lot from improving my storage, virtualization, networking, systems, and ansible/automation skills to be able to support a datacenter/campus.

I'll be replacing  a 6504 VSS stack and nexus 5k distribution with nexus 9K's and reconnecting the access layer and datacenter (UCS  and NetApp) port-channels. These 6504's have been running a bit too long :) with EoL next year glad to replace them and get updated code. At the same time I'll be removing VTP from the switches and re-configuring the VLANs on the access layer (the exact same VLANs trying to minimize changes)

My current plan is as follows in a converged infrastructure in a non-certified ""flexpod""

1. Make sure we have all documentation for IPAM, management addresses, and non-domain/active directory passwords in a location that is accessible while the network is in outage mode and export the password vault system to an encrypted offline file and all SSH private keys. In addition also have TFTP copies of all startup/running configs for all cisco devices, UCS, VMware config export, RVtools export, netapp sysconfig, and palo alto firewalls export.
2. Shutdown all VMware level VMs and domain controllers (hosting DNS, DHCP, and AD).
3. Shut down ESXi Cisco UCS hosts but leave the UCS/FI's running.
4. Leave NetApp cluster (A700 and FAS8200) running.
5. Replace Core l2/l3 network with new Nexus 9k with a logical migration of the configuration (which I""m confident in the most as most of my experience is in networking).
6. Start up ESXi hosts/blades via UCS FI mgmt https once l2/l3 back online which mount NFSv3 to netapp datastores (which haven't been shutoff).
7. Connect to ESXi host mgmt https and start up domain controllers (bring up DNS, DHCP, and AD service) with offline local ESXi admin/password.
8. Once AD/DNS is running bring up the rest of the environment/services and test everything with the whole team.

Thats my rough/high-level playbook. I'll be labeling all fiber/Cat6 mgmt/data ports ahead of time to allow re-patching to be easy, fast, and stress free.

I have a couple of fluke fiber cleaning kits while disconnecting all the SMF/MMF fiber and have extra SMF/MMF patch cords and Ethernet cat6 patch cords as well. At this point I feel like I'm ready and have nothing else to do, so I figured talking to the community would be the best course of action right now.

Extremely gratefull for any feedback, insight, and advice for my plan I've laid out in advance and your experience doing similar work.

Update: Much thanks for all feedback already provided.

I figured out the connectivity issue (unrelated problem), but while doing packet captures with the Palo tech we both noticed something we couldn't explain - the Palo was sending an arp reply to the ISP gateway saying that the Palo's MAC address owns the base network address.

For example, let's say the ISP gives us a public IP range of 1.1.1.0/29. ISP's gateway is 1.1.1.1, and the Palo's interface is 1.1.1.5. The Palo's MAC address on that interface is 01:02:03:04:05:06.

I'm seeing the Palo answer arps for 1.1.1.0 with it's MAC address 01:02:03:04:05:06.

This raises some questions:

1 Why would a device arp the base network address 1.1.1.0?

2. What should a device do when it sees an arp for the base network address?

3. Wireshark sees the normal arp replies for 1.1.1.1 giving the ISP's MAC address and sees these bogus arp replies to 1.1.1.0 with the Palo's MAC and flags a warning that multiple MACs are using the same IP. Why does wireshark consider 1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.0 to be the same address. Wireshark doesn't know the subnet mask, and wouldn't even know 1.1.1.0 isn't a legitimate IP.

Anyone know the answer to any of these questions with certainty?

We have a forescout appliance, that if a host is out of policy automatically puts into a vlan 404. So there is an ip to vlan mismatch with no communication. Well info sec wants to be able to test that the vulnerability has been fixed before putting back on prod. 

Problem is We have static ips on all our printers and desktops. And only have voice vlans at corp and remore locations that have high voicd traffic as normal locations only have 6 or 7 phones.

After discussing with the team, we have come to the conclusion that changing ALL our desktops/printers from a static addresses to DHCP would allow the forescout device be able to communicate with the devices it has put on quarantine, but some caveats have arose.
What needs to be tested:

•	Stand up a superscope dhcp for mac binding (every printer and desktop gets the same ip back when goes from prod to Quarantine back to prod) 

•	Would need to create a voice vlan at every branch so when the forscout puts the device on vlan 404, associates are still able to call into tech support. 

•	Need to verify that once a port is changes vlans that the port does an automatic shut/no shut without manual intervention 

^ the last one is what my main question is about but any suggestions over all would help. When a port on a cisco switch changes a vlan does it shut/no shut... So if it dhcp bound it gets put back on the right ip to vlan mapping. Ie no manual intervention at all

475,t3_g35qvd,"A client of mine has a 5406 chassis switch that has been happily powering two PoE devices for years. It is equipped with a single ~~275~~875W PSU and two 24-Port GigE PoE blades. We recently started adding additional APs and an IP Camera for a total of five PoE devices and now the switch is throwing *""PD Denied power due to insufficient power allocation""* errors, and all five PoE devices are being randomly dropped off of the network. I mostly see the aforementioned error as the switch itself is powering up, but it also crops up long after bootup too.

At other times, all PoE devices will drop their data link from the network but don't seem to lose PoE. At no time is there a message to indicate why either issue is occurring, just that it has happened. When either problem occurs (either PoE or data), they occur to ALL active PoE ports ONLY - that is to say, non-PoE port members never have issues and if I move PoE devices to another port, the problems follow.

*show power brief* indicates 258W of remaining power, 17W allocated to each port, and each PD actively using less than 5W each (AP datasheet says 8W max, for reference). PoE is disabled on all ports that don't need it and I tried enabling *""no lldp config A1-A24 dot3TlvEnable poeplus_config""* per support's recommendation.

In the logs post-bootup I see each PD come online and request power and followed immediately by the above deny message. Then 5-10 seconds later the PD's will request power again but this time the switch applies power without any complaints. The bigger problem is this process will randomly repeat long after the PoE devices have been operating - could be 30 minutes, could be 48 hours; there's not much consistency in the pattern so far.

Upon playing with the debug lldp and power cycling one of the APs, I see the following:

0001:19:34:45.51 LLDP mlldpCtrl: 8023at: PoeMgr PowerUpdate  to LLDP (mtype = LOC_SYS_CHG) on port A7
0001:19:34:45.51 LLDP mlldpCtrl: 8023at: PowerUpdate values PseAloc=26,PdReq=130 (Type=2, Source=1, Priority=3) on port A7
0001:19:34:45.51 LLDP mlldpCtrl: device status changed : 11

... According to Aruba this indicate that my APs are requesting 130W of PoE power (PdReq=130). Based on that it seems easy enough to blame the Ruckus APs, BUT: I see the exact same request from my HIKVision IP Camera too. It already seems implausible that these old APs would be asking for 130W, but it seems even more unlikely that the switch would be reporting the same issue for a completely different vendor's product. I have also deployed hundreds of these APs before on ProCurve switches and have never seen this before.

My next step is going to be connecting these same PoE devices to a different ProCurve switch to see what it reports - can you all think of anything else I can look at or test or may be missing? It seems unlikely that this is truly a PD or cabling issue but Aruba seems to have their minds made up that this is a Ruckus problem.

We had seen a lot of broadcast traffic coming over a link from our old DR location, there is as MAN between it and the primary. They had not limited the ports to the VLAN chosen to link the two, so each side (due to again bad choices of using the same VLAN numbering) could pass broadcast traffic from one to the other. Once the ports were configured to allow only that VLAN broadcast traffic stopped on that link and my primary site calmed down quite a bit.

So here is my question:

At the ""DR"" site I am seeing ARP floods around every 60 seconds. Wireshark indicates these are all from the Cisco Nexus 9k (9396px). Can anyone think of why the nexus would be doing this in that interval? I have searched and scoured forums looking for what this could be, but due to my own ignorance (I am learning...) I am sure there is something I am missing.

Could it be the arp cache aging timeout?

Thanks to anyone who spends a few seconds on this, I appreciate it!

Edit:

ARP timeouts are default, 1500 seconds (25 minutes).

481,t3_g31yqc,"**TL;DR:** Dev, not an expert in networking. Trying to simulate really bad WAN connection for benchmarking. I came up with a way how to do it but not completely sure about it. Pls help me verify that my setup makes sense. I am afraid my benchmarking-results won't be meaningful at all if I make any mistake at this stage.

&amp;nbsp;

Hello fellow redditors,

I am a developper trying to create an application that should works well even under bad WAN conditions (High latency, potentially high loss, maybe over VPN, ...). To verify that my application works well enough I tried to build a testing environment where I can simulate different network conditions.

&amp;nbsp;

I read a lot of blog posts on how to do this under Linux. I found out that Linux has a lot of the tools needed already on board (tc and netem). I came up with a setup that consists of three ubuntu VMs (server, client and router) and two virtual networks between them. I made tried to make a drawing ([benchmark-arcitecture.png](https://postimg.cc/8FDHJCNF)) to make my setup clearer for you. I configured the router VM to IP-Forward so client and server can reach each other. To then simulate the network latency/loss/bandwidth I created below script that is executed on the router Ubuntu-VM.
   
    #!/bin/bash
    LATENCY=""50ms""
    JITTER=""10ms""
    JITTER_CORRELATION=""25%""
    LOSS=""0.1%""
    LOSS_CORRELATION=""25%""
    RATE=""10mbit""
   
    sudo tc qdisc del dev enp0s3 root
    sudo tc qdisc del dev enp0s8 root
   
    sudo tc qdisc add dev enp0s3 root handle 1: netem delay $LATENCY $JITTER $JITTER_CORRELATION distribution normal loss $LOSS $LOSS_CORRELATION rate $RATE 
    sudo tc qdisc add dev enp0s8 root handle 1: netem delay $LATENCY $JITTER $JITTER_CORRELATION distribution normal loss $LOSS $LOSS_CORRELATION rate $RATE

The thing I am the most unsure about in this setup are the two `tc`-commands. I built them together from different things I read in several blog-posts. With some trial-and-error i got it all to work. Now I am somewhat afraid that I made some mistake in this setup that would later cause all my benchmarking-results to be not meaningful at all.

&amp;nbsp;

Now here are my questions:

1. Is it really true, that I need the `tc`/`netem` command for both network interfaces (because they only apply to outgoing packages). I am afraid of accidentally adding twice as much network-crappiness as I intend to in this way.

2. Do you think that this approach can work/is any good at simulating realistic bad network conditions?

3. Maybe do you know a better solution how to simulate bad WAN conditions?

4. I already used `ping`, `tracepath` and `iperf3` to try to verify that the connection actually behaves as I am expecting. Do you have any other suggestions how I could verify that my network simulator behaves in a realistic way.

5. Little bit off the original topic: What do you think would be some really bad (but still realistic) network conditions (latency/jitter/loss/bandwith) that I should be using for my testing.

Of course any other suggestions on that topic are very welcome.

483,t3_g30502,"Hi all,

I would like to share with you the adventure I have had the latest 3 weeks in my attempt to perform a firmware upgrade on a pair of Nexus 5596UP switches.

Background: We have 2 nexus 5596UP switches with a L3 card installed and multiple vPCs going through them. No FEX devices, but 3750s are hanging out of those switches, among other things.

Those switches run EIGRP, BGP, IPv6, PIM, MSDP to name a few. They had around \~650 days of uptime and they are both complaining about TCAM Exhaustion among other things. Anyway, we hit a bug that would not prepend AS paths when being redistributed via BGP so i thought i would take the challenge to upgrade them.

I write the change, I take a show run, ver, spanning tree, vpc, license, arp, arp all vrfs, ip route, ip route all vrfs and begin to upgrade switch 2.

I issue the command ""install all kickstart bootflash:///kistart-whatever.bin system bootflash:///whatever.bin &lt;cr&gt;

It does the calculations, tells me that I am running Layer 3 services therefore a downtime HAS to happen and I press ""y"". The switch initiates a reboot. Note that I was doing that remotely, via a remote console server.

I can see in the console that the reboot process has initiated, and then nothing. I wait 5-10-15 minutes and no output from the console. I then decided to physically visit the DC.

Entering the comms room, I can see that the switch is powered on, but no LEDs are blinking besides the PSU and the STAT. No console output. After a couple of power cycles, I called Cisco to raise a P1 case. While waiting for the case to be created, I searched on my phone ""Cisco nexus not booting"".

I came out with FN  64094 - Nexus 5596/UCS FI 6296 - System Fails to Boot After a Power Cycle - Workaround Provided  
 [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/field-notices/640/fn64094.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/field-notices/640/fn64094.html)

I was thinking ""sh\*t"".

TAC entered the WebEx chat and asked me to provide console output. I said there is none. I have already power cycled twice with no luck. I have then pasted the FN URL in the chat. The engineer responds with something like:

""Please give me a minute to read this""

3 minutes later:

""I will send an RMA unit.""

&amp;#x200B;

Note that this was a Saturday in a COVID-19 lock-down! Although a bit stressed, this was the most exciting thing that happened to me in days! I have arranged with the courier, the DC provider and the device came. I then unboxed it, put the current firmware in, tried to copy the whole config (note it does not work and manual intervention is required), and notice that we are missing features due to licensing.

I then decide to label all switchports with the label printer. Power down the faulty switch. Understand how to unrack that beast; remove the ears from the broken one, put them in the RMA, rack the RMA back, plug all the cables in and power it on. Note that all ports are currently in shut state because the config is not fully applied yet.

I save the old switch in the racks somewhere, but I could not save the box since we do not have a cage in that DC, and all the OPs left (it was 22:00 local time). So I put it in a corner somewhere, hoping they do not dispose it.

The next day I am reporting that to my line manager and explaining that I need the license to be installed before finishing config. License came, I have installed it, finished copying and verifying the config and I go physically to the DC. I get there, I do a ""no shut"" on all the ports and so far so good!

The next morning I get some email alerts showing that the switch has crashed overnight due to:

Reason: Reset performed due to component Error

 System version: 7.3(3)N1(1)

 Service: SUNNYVALE ASIC FAILURE

&amp;#x200B;

Sent the tech-support output to Cisco which then dispatched another RMA. Note that this was during the Easter weekend which the device was supposed to be sent on Thursday afternoon, but came Monday at around 21:00. So I raised another emergency change to swap the RMA with another RMA switch.

I am now at the same place I was before the upgrade. I am in the process of raising a change to preemptively patch Switch1 so it does not hit that field notice. After that I will be able to successfully upgrade the 2 switches.

TL:DR. I tried to upgrade the firmware on a Nexus switch, the device crashed, Cisco sent an RMA which crashed the next day and they sent an RMA for their RMA.",My banter of the day. Upgrading Cisco Nexus switch.,r/networking,0.9,88,31,{},0

I'm hoping you can shed some light on an issue that  I'm trying to get closure on. I design and install custom home &amp; business automation systems. RTI is my choice product, it interfaces with various TouchPads, handheld remotes, and of course an app.

A command processor is central to all of the devices in the system. This works great with only certain routers. We normally use Ubiquiti and Luxul products, and it's smooth sailing, so we mostly stick to this every chance we get. But sometimes in corporate environments they don't want our equipment on their network for security. In this case, we just need a basic router to handle a few devices.

I believe rti hardware &amp; the app rely on a broadcast from the command processor in order to ""locate"" &amp; communicate. Wireshark shows very regular broadcasts every second or two from the processor. This will work for a few hours between 2 - 12 hrs without issue. Then it just disconnects and the only fix is to reboot the processor and the cycle repeats, some random period later, it's lost again. This happens for sure on netgear, linksys, and of course the crap the cable company hands out.

RTI has some pretty smart people on its team, they only use Luxul and that's as much info they can give on the subject of networking unfortunately. 

Bottom line, I'm curious what the deal is with this! It bothers me that the reason has not surfaced over the 8 years of working with this line of products. Can Broadcast &amp; Multicast break or some service discovery be ignored on certain routers?

So, start running tracerts and pings, and just establishing a baseline for my network, which is admittedly janky as a fox, but that's a different (albeit, embarrassing) post.

Could that be causing my issues? I have machines on my net that return DC.contoso.com as the same funky address as the Amazon lookup. Is that my connectivity issue? I just don't know. The issue is super intermittent, and sometimes the machines work fine, other times I lose my domain trust relationship, but it's hard to see, since my users sit at their desks and run on cached profiles.

I don't understand how Tcp/IP packets can be insured against corruption with just a 16bit checksum.  Hypothetically this should miss 1 in 16000 errors, which isn't much.  The reading I have found on the internet says that the ethernet frame has CRC 32bit error checking, which is supposed to mitigate this problem, but my understanding is the ethernet frame is stripped before sending over the internet, which would mean the CRC check doesn't help with any errors accumulated over the transport of the packet over the internet.

Can someone tell me what I am not understanding please?

498,t3_g2jqzi,"Hi Network Admins,

Does anyone know if sFlow can be used to monitor VOIP?

Here’s why I ask, and why I think the answer to my question will be “***No.***”  I’ve recently spun up an instance of vFlow, Verizon Digital’s Dockerized sFlow Docker collector.  The image works great, and I highly recommend it.  My boss likes it too, and asked me to think about if we might be able to use vFlow to monitor VOIP calls.

Here’s everything I know about VOIP:

* VOIP uses two protocols: SIP is used for signaling, RTP is used to carry actual voice data.
* When a VOIP call is initiated between two peers, those peer negotiate using SIP (UDP 5060).  In one of those initial “handshake” packets, the peers will communicate, “***You send RTP on UDP 12345, I’ll send RTP back on UDP 12346.***”
* Once that step is completed, all RTP packets for the duration of the call will use only those agreed-upon UDP ports.
* After the call is completed, there is a quick tear-down process, also managed via SIP.

Okay, now imagine Peers A and B are initiating a VOIP call over my sFlow-enabled network.  Here’s what I think happens:

1. Via SIP, peers A and B agree that A will used RTP on UDP 12345 and B will use RTP on UDP 12346.
2. However, sFlow does ***NOT*** sample that key SIP packet containing the previous information.
3. A and B begin their VOIP call and begin transferring a lot of RTP data.
4. sFlow reports a lot of traffic on UDP 12345 and 12346. However, there is no way for sFlow to realize this is VOIP traffic.

Because of the nature of random packet sampling, I’m guessing the above scenario happens almost constantly.  To see a batch of traffic on UDP 12345 and 12346 and then know for sure that that traffic is VOIP, sFlow would need to sample the SIP packet listing the agreed-upon ports, and the SIP packets used to teardown the call later.  What are the odds that those SIP packets will be sampled for every VOIP call?  Practically nil.

I did a bit of Google searching for “sFlow VOIP” but all I see to find are ad websites for professional sFlow products and academic papers.  I’m guessing that this means garden variety sFlow simply can’t monitor VOIP, for the reasons I’ve listed above.

Does anyone know if I am correct?  I would love any thoughts or advice on this. Thank you!",Can sFlow monitor VOIP? (I'm guessing no.),r/networking,0.64,5,14,{},0

Currently have some tasks around pulling together some central process for the upkeep of our infrastructure (Patching critical devices for vulnerabilities/ bugs etc).

My initial thoughts were NSOT  (Netbox?) w/inventory of devices &gt; interacts with devices to get the latest data (NAPALM/ ANSIBLE) &gt; interacts with vulnerability data (Via Public APIs) &gt;  engineer reviews data (New vulnerability this version X is vulnerable)  and initiates upgrades.

I have a Azure VNet with a network gateway using a S2S connection. This gives access to the target network I need to access.

I want to be able to connect to this VNet using Azure VPN client *(this would mean P2S)*.

 successfully ping google.com between resetting the firewall and switch yet webpages were not loading in a browser.

Navigating to another page is when the page stalls (according to Chrome Dev Network Tools) for 20-30 seconds and usually won't load. Restarting Chrome lets me access the new page near instantly.

553,t3_g0icpd,"HI, I have read several post saying mikrotik has better routers for starting up a WISP because you can configure much more and has more features. But most of these posts are quite a few years old and I know Ubiquiti has added lots of those features to their Edgerouters. Is there still a big difference between them? I use Edgerouter for our business, and I am looking into starting a very small community WISP and not sure if I should use Edgerouter or look into learning Mikrotik

Also how do Mikrotik CRS switches compare to Edgeswitches? I notice Mikrotik switches are much cheaper but look less powerfull for L3. But Edgeswitches are quite limited with their L3 features too. So probably best idea is to just use them as L2 switch.",Difference Mikrotik and Edgerouter,r/networking,0.64,3,28,{},0
554,t3_g0ayze,"Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with or can throw out some advice on how to load balance multiple *incoming* RTMP streams. I realise that there are TONS of articles etc about load balancing *outgoing* streams to viewers, but we're a media company who ingests streams at scale so we're on the other end of the spectrum.

At the moment, we pre-provision a dedicated ""slot"" on a server instance running Wowza Streaming Engine for each client source that we sign up (up to a maximum of 5 per server) - obviously this is not:

1. Scalable or
2. Sustainable or
3. Affordable

We're going through a phase of really rapid growth at the moment, and I would much rather find a way to have a standing pool of available servers which I can dynamically allocate individually per incoming stream as required - that way we're only really worried about ""how many streams we're ingesting concurrently"" rather than ""how many servers do I need to have running in case *X* clients send us a stream"". Basically it will mean instead of having 25 servers running 24/7 to ingest 125 *potential* streams, we can run, say, 15 or 20 smaller servers to handle one connection each, but concurrently - ideally even only spin up the required number of servers for a known number of concurrent scheduled streams (if we know we're only going to be doing 10 concurrent ingests, then we only need 10 instance running).

Happy to give more detail where necessary - I've looked into some potential solutions such as DSR, OpenResty and HAProxy, but I think I really need to just start with some basic networking advice.",Load balance multiple incoming RTMP streams,r/networking,0.76,10,18,{},0

**NXOS Blame** enables you to determine who made what change on a cisco nexus switch in a cute and tidy GUI. This was inspired by the blame feature on Github. 

&amp;nbsp;

The way this works is heavily reliant on the ""show accounting log"" command available on Cisco Nexus devices. The output from that command is then compared with the running configuration.

&amp;nbsp;

Keep in mind that this project is proof of concept. In a real production environment, it's probably better to collect ""show accounting log"" daily and accumulate the dataset so that older accounting data is not lost. :)

As the title says have any of you guys ever been though mergers/acquisitions from a networking point of view?

I dealt with the banking industry before but I have never had to merge multiple  bank networks  into  one  bank before, is their anything I should be aware of during this process, i\`m aware of asset management, PCI compliance stuff, overlapping addressing, (not sure what routing looks like as yet or switching)

Any tips from your environments on a good  recommended latency for finance/banking applications such as fiserv, Temenos?

Any tips on what would be a best practise approach overall would be appreciated.

559,t3_fzv062,"*Disclaimer: this is for a uni assignment, but I am after troubleshooting help with a specific problem rather than general help.*

I am creating an network across 2 buildings. I have layer 3 switches acting as my main routers in each building with a fibre connection between them. These connect to L3 switches in each company department which provide PoE to IP phones and onwards to the PC behind the phone.

I have a dedicated Call Manager (CM) Router set up in each building, directly connected to the main L3 routing switch. Every phone has successfully registered and I can call other phones in the same building. However, I cannot call a phone in another building.

I also discovered that I cannot ping the CM router in either network from any device (either in the same building or outside it). I can only ping as far as the gateway interface to the device.

I think it is a routing issue, but I am stumped as the call managers clearly work and have a connection to my network or the phones wouldn't work.

Do you have any suggestions for things to check or something I am missing to enable cross-building phone calls and/or to ping the CM routers?

**Network set up notes:**

* Each department is it's own VLAN and the voice has it's own VLAN. Voice and Access ports are all set up.
* Inter-vlan routing is OK - I can ping from PCs in one building to PCs/Servers/Wireless devices in the other.
* EIGRP is set up on both the building L3 switches doing the routing but not the department ones
* Every network is listed correctly in the EIGRP topology table

**EDIT:** added EIGRP topology table in case it helps

In case it helps, my running config on main L3 switch in building A - 1/0/24 is the CM int, vlan 98 is voice vlan:

Hi Guys!

I was assigned to a team that has to config dot1x to a company switches. My main domain is routing and switching only but i have done some research about the command usage.

Here's the template i got from the PM (Port only):

*-----------------*

interface range fastEthernet 0/1-24

 switchport access vlan X (Data)

 switchport mode access

 switchport voice vlan Y (Voice)

 authentication event fail action next-method

 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan X (Data) (Same Vlan X in the switchport access vlan X command)

 authentication event server dead action authorize voice

 authentication event server alive action reinitialize

 authentication host-mode multi-domain

 authentication order dot1x mab webauth

 authentication priority dot1x mab webauth

 authentication port-control auto

mab

 dot1x pae authenticator

 spanning-tree portfast

*-----------------*

*Let me explain the commands with my understanding first.*

*The commands:*

*-----------------*

authentication host-mode multi-domain

 authentication event fail action next-method

 authentication order dot1x mab webauth

 authentication priority dot1x mab webauth

 authentication port-control auto

*-----------------*

This is a port which has a Computer with an IP Phone attached to it. The order of authentication is dot1x, MAC Address, webauth, and the last line is enable dot1x on the port.

Now these command that i think i don't fully understand, it would be great if you guys can help me clarify these:

The commands:

*-----------------*

 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan X (Data)

 authentication event server dead action authorize voice

 authentication event server alive action reinitialize

mab

 dot1x pae authenticator

*-----------------*

When the Radius servers is dead the voice device will be placed in the voice vlan command in the interface configuration, and the computer will be placed in the data vlan in the switchport access command. User start authenticate to Radius server when the servers are up again.

What do the **mab** and **dot1x pae authenticator** do?

In this configuration, i don't see the commands that help the PC &amp; IPPhone to authenticate to radius server or talk with ISE when the servers is up but when i use the config, everything works fine. Am i missing something?

I hope you guys can help me.

561,t3_fzlqp1,"Hey guys,

Are any of you guys managing a VPN so video editors can edit from home on HP's RGS soultion? What is your experience like with dual monitors vs single monitor?

We  have a few editors having some problems with lag or pixelations. The  internet on both sides is good. The latency and the bandwidth are good.

Our  VPN seems good. It gets around 50Mbps per thread. So if I do an SMB  speed test I get around 50Mbps. And if I do a FTP transfer across ten  threads I get around 300Mbps.

I’m  wondering if the single thread way the vpn seems to bottleneck has  anything to do with the lag. The editor has 1 gig up and down and so  does the office. So it’s not bandwidth.

I can see that the bandwidth uses around 30Mbps per user. So I’m a little hesitant to blame the VPN.

Anyways I just want to know what your guys experience is with RGS?

I already set management IP to my controller and logged into it to create Sample Guest SSID (I am not the best in wireless btw).

565,t3_fyygsw,"This isn't an active design challenge that I have, but I'd like to have an idea about how you all are securing your management environments today. 

* Are you relying on special jump hosts, VDIs, or VPNs for your administrators to use?
* Do you have a physical NOC set up with its own privileged subnet?
* Are you leveraging 801.1x or similar technologies to ensure your administrators' devices are assigned to privileged subnets?
* Are you not putting any network-based restrictions on access to management IP addresses?
* Have you adopted some alternative strategy?

Relying only on the jump host option seems extremely dangerous since a network failure could prevent you from accessing the very infrastructure you need to fix the network. But leaving everything open, particularly for out of band, seems risky too (anyone with the console line credentials could access a network device).

I would approach this by using 802.1x to ensure that all administrators belong to a special IP subnet, and allow that subnet access to the VTY lines and out of band terminal servers. If 802.1x wasn't an option, I probably would allow the entire enterprise IP space to have access to the VTY lines, but set up a special jump host for out-of-band access.

574,t3_fygo91,"Hi ALL, I studying DMVPN phase 3 and would like to ask if you can answer some of my question and issue that I'm working on right now. 

Topology: [https://imgur.com/ZLYelUk](https://imgur.com/ZLYelUk)

Description: From the topology, I have 3 sites A, B and C and all routers are DMVPN configured. From the topology also you can see that Site B and C (spoke-to-spoke) communication is working but Site A &amp; B is not working. 

**Questions:**

1. In which specific database HUB stores the route information from its spoke routers ? if is based on RIB, FIB or NHRP database ? with this, HUB know where to forward the traffic and also this being use to send a redirect whenever there a better path that spoke could use.
2. From the topology, Site A has a preferred path from HUB perceptive which is to forward Site A lan network to another PE and not directly to HUB. With this, this affect the spoke-to-spoke communication. Could you give input about this, Does hub needs to have the best path towards to its Peer tunnel to send a redirect (related to #1)?
3. Can we able to run a spoke-to-spoke test between Site A and Site B using their tunnel interface IP addresses since it is directly connected and not being manipulated?

&amp;#8203;

    example:
    Site A - R2 (tunnel 0 - 192.168.1.10/24)
    Site B - R (tunnel 0 - 192.168.1.20/24)
    
    SiteA# ping 192.168.1.20 source 192.168.1.10
    Result: Working
    SiteA# trace 192.168.1.20 source 192.168.1.10
    Result: 2hops away - HUB -&gt; SITEB ROUTER
    
    Same result with Siteb to Sitea ping and trace.

4.  All spoke routers have IPSEC profile configured but Site A and Site B ***spoke-to-spoke communication unable to fully form phase2 IPSEC.*** All policies, attributes are the same since we cannot form an adjacency with hub if there something missing... So believe this is due to the fact we cannot form a spoke-to-spoke communication because of the preferred path? BTW im using the tunnel interfaces to test (see #3 sample).

Being mostly a systems engineer these days I also have to tend to some networking in our school here and I've been working with a couple of FASTPATH-based switches from Netgear, Ubiquiti and Dell lately and int the past.

From time to time I'm trying to revisit old habits in order to check if I an initial choice was good or not if time allows. I'm trying to decide whether switchport mode general vs.  switchport mode access/trunk are wiser to use or if it's just a matter of personal taste. :-)

Most of these FASTPATH-based switches tend to use ""switchport mode general"" by default where VLAN partiticipation, tagging and PVID has to be defined (also ingress filtering often is not enabled by default). Based on checking with older models of those vendors, general mode used to be the only available mode in FASTPATH. Access/trunk modes have their origins in IOS and were added by Broadcom a couple of years ago and now exist alongside seemingly without an intend to drop one or another config mode.

I've compared a port config of an access port when in general vs. access mode as well as general vs. trunk mode. The port configs tend to be a bit shorter and (by my personal taste) less clunky than in general mode. (roughly 2 lines per port)

Of course mixing both general vs. access/trunk usage is likely unwise as it might rather lead to confusion... but any preferences from day-to-day experiences?",FASTPATH-based switches: switchport mode general vs. access/trunk?,r/networking,0.85,47,19,{},0

This should work right? Tho' as soon as I enable QinQ on the DLS, I lose connection with the ALS trough VLAN 10. I can't ping anymore. Do I have to enable QinQ globally in some way on the 5710?

580,t3_fy93j4,"I work with several large enterprise customers and most of them are getting rid of their onsite data centers. They are either moving all their applications to cloud providers, moving their DCs into colocations, or doing a mix of both. This means that soon enough, all client-to-server traffic will flow over the WAN, with the campus essentially becoming one large remote-site. As for client-to-client traffic, I won't say it doesn't exist, but it is relatively inconsequential.  VoIP RTP sessions don't take up much bandwidth, and the same goes for Machine-to-Machine IOT traffic.

Now that I've established what current and future traffic flows look like, let's talk about WAN connectivity. Outside of DCs, none of my customers have any circuits larger than 1gb; in fact, line rate, dedicated GigE circuits are still pretty rare. As DC sites, they all have 1gb to 10gb circuits for branch WAN aggregation, centralized corporate internet/cloud access, and data center interconnection. But what will happen to these sites when they no longer host DCs or provide branch WAN aggregation? Well, I fully expect my customers to decommission their 10gb circuits and move to 1gb or even 500mb services at their campuses. 

We're looking at a future where (1) all substantial traffic flows will be constrained to the size of WAN links and (2) WAN links at former ""hub"" sites will be sized only based on the needs of local users. So why is Cisco pushing access-layer switches with multi-gig access ports and 25/40/100gb uplinks? It seems to me that 1GigE access ports and 10GigE Trunks are still more-than-sufficient for today's requirements. Now I get why someone might argue for 25gb uplinks - switches don't have nearly the same buffering capabilities as routers, so you want your campus backbone to be oversized. But giving a user or a single AP a switchport that's sized like a WAN circuit in a world where *everything* goes over the WAN? That sounds like nonsense to me. 

I get that there's product lifecycle to consider, but until you can get a 25GigE circuit for the same price as today's 1GigE's, (not something that I see happening in the next 5 years...) this whole technology and ""push"" from Cisco seems pointless to me.

I'm looking for your help because my Google skill failed me and I can't seem to find any information about this in Cisco documentation.

We have a Cisco ISE deployment working fine with MAB for years and now the next logical step is using 802.1x with certificate.

Certificate means checking the CRL from the sub-CA delivering client certificats and I don't have any problem to configure this. 

My issue is that the security team want us to check the ARL (Authority Revocation List) and I can't find a way to do this. Is it just checking the root CA CRL, is it an other option that I am missing or is it just not possible ?

I tunnel all [0.0.0.0/0](https://0.0.0.0/0) traffic via the ASA. Any traffic destination for O365/sfb/teams etc, I include in a DNS-split-exclude configuration.

I also use proxy-pac files and whitelist domains to send traffic direct/local if I do not want the domain to use the internal proxies.

If connected to ASA cluster one (DC1), which currently has no DNS-exclude split tunnel configuration added, and is only using proxy pac config, it works. I can traceroute to domain name (i.e [login.live.com](https://login.live.com)) and I can see the next hop is my local router. 

If Connected to ASA cluster two (DC2), which **has** DNS-exclude split tunnel config, it does not work. I can see traffic hitting our proxy and traceroute fails. 

Please note, we do not add any proxy config to the AnYConnect profiles/Group policys, we just use the browser pac file to direct https to the internal proxies, unless excluded/whitelisted. 

I just added DNS-Exclude split tunnel configuration to DC1 cluster and it is still works.

We have a handful of users who lose their split-dns functionality after they are connected to the VPN for awhile.  Basically regular internet resolution works and the tunnel actually still stays active.  (They can ping internal resources by IP only).  When they try to ping internal DNS name, using the on prem Microsoft DNS server it just says ""Ping request could not find host xyz.helloworld.local Please check the name and try again."" In the browser it will say they recieved a NXDOMAIN response.  Doing a packet capture it doesnt look like the traffic even makes it to the DNS server.

Funny enough nslookup will work, but I researched that it stated: 

**Note**: **Avoid using NSLookup when you test the name resolution on the client.** Instead, rely on a browser or use ping. This is because NSLookup does not rely on the operating system (OS) DNS resolver, and therefore, AnyConnect does not force the DNS request via a certain interface.

&amp;nbsp;
 
About a year ago we redid the wifi in our building. We went through a vendor that handles our network switches and firewall/vpn appliance. They mapped out the area, determined the optimal positioning of the APs, and we had another vendor that pulls our low voltage cabling to do the cable runs and mount the APs in the predetermined positions. After they were installed and set up, the vendor made another map of the radio signals to confirm that the coverage was optimal. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
We have 15 WatchGuard AP420s installed at our production facility. They are using POE+ injectors (only some of our switches had POE+) and are split up between our MDF and two IDFs. Some days the wifi is stout and we get the speeds you would expect to see. Other days it is *horrible* to the point where it's almost unusable. Today I was trying to move install media from a network drive to a client workstation. It was roughly 5 GB and it was transferring at a rate of ~250-750 KB/s and estimating that it would complete it 2+ hours. When I connected to the ethernet, the transfer took about 1.5 minutes. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
The kicker is, right now over 50% of our company is working remotely and there are not nearly as many wireless clients as we would normally see. I have reached out to the vendor numerous times, and any time they've come on site, there are virtually no issues and the system is working as expected.

607,t3_fx07mi,"So how do you use RED/WRED at your company? I've done a lot of QOS implementations, and I've always questioned the value of RED with how most companies implement it.

I've heard arguments that it helps prevent TCP global synchronization, but is synchronization actually happening in your network without a RED profile? Most of the research I've read showing global synchronization conducted their testing in a controlled environment with flows having similar characteristics (algorithm, latency, processing time, RTT). I have not seen global synchronization in our production network, nor have I seen it in a lab where we weren't explicitly trying to create it. Reading through some research where different RTTs and different processing times are used, you don't see global synchronization occurring.

What's consistent with a lot of the research I've read through is fairness and latency. RED is fairer to bursty traffic or traffic with long RTT. But for the most likely scenarios, tail-drop works fine or may even be better for smooth non-bursty traffic. In any case, the average of drop probability and throughput between tail-drop and RED are pretty identical. While latency can be far lower with RED, that's because you're essentially lowering the queue depth. This could be ideal in specific scenarios, especially with WRED. But that kind of granularity requires engineers to have an excellent understanding of their traffic flows and needs.

What I often find with most deployments, RED/WRED is implemented without really knowing if it provides any benefit. There are a few scenarios where I could see the benefit, but I don't even know if the benefit is worth the added complexity.

So if you have RED/WRED implemented in your network, how is it implemented and what benefit does it provide? How did you determine the min and max thresholds and drop probability? Have you done testing to show that it actually provides an advantage over just doing tail-drop, or is it all theoretical?",Benefits of RED/WRED,r/networking,0.8,15,29,{},0

628,t3_fwjvxg,"Hi

I have a situation with Fortigate (501E), no VDOMs. Routing is ""on a stick"" - no L3 switches.

&amp;#x200B;

1. There is a web server on [10.10.104.31](https://10.10.104.31) (VLAN 104) with VIPs (x.y.89.164:80-&gt; [10.10.104.31:80](https://10.10.104.31:80) and ICMP x.y.89.164 -&gt; [10.10.104.31](https://10.10.104.31))
2. There is a policy which allows ANY -&gt; VLAN 104 for these VIPs
3. There is a routed network x.y.78.0/24 on internal network (VLAN 71)
4. There is a server x.y.78.30 on said network (VLAN 71)
5. There is policy which allows VLAN 71 -&gt; ANY

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is server x.y.78.30 can connect anywhere on the internet EXCEPT this service (x.y.89.164)On the diag debug flow (with filter ""addr x.y.78.30"") I can see only packets going in, and they are allowed by policy, ant correctly DNAT'ed to 10.10.104.31

On the other hands ping (x.y.78.30 -&gt; x.y.89.164) works, but the ping reply comes from [10.10.104.31](https://10.10.104.31)!

asymroute is enabled.

I just can't wrap my head around this, is this NAT somehow not registering ? But it doesn't show even reply direction packets from [10.10.104.31](https://10.10.104.31) (even when using ping).

If this would be a same internal network - I would just hairpin NAT to router IP ant call it a day, but on  webserver's logs I want to see the real IP (x.y.78.30).

Do you have any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

so i am trying to figure out how the best way would be to set up the following:  
\- 2 core switches, 2 different companies.  
\- STP needs to work for both companies but should not interfere with the other.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally i would choose to place a router in between the two core switches but in this case it is not a possibility. The switch managed on my end is a Huawei CE6810 (running ""stp root primary"") and i think i need the following commands (on the uplink to the other core) to achieve what i want/need:

stp disable  
stp bpdu-filter enable (does this even make sense if i disable stp?)

&amp;#x200B;

Is this enough to achieve what i want? I have no control over the other core switch so i can not confirm its config but i want all incoming bpdu's ignored, and send none their way. But i don't want the port to go down either. 

To my understanding using ""stp edged-port"" here would shut the port as soon as any bpdu's are being noticed is that correct?

I currently work in an environment with a multi datacenter setup. We are connecting the datacenters via private cross connects using the colo's backbone. On the initial setup we ran into spanning tree issues that were beyond my understanding (tri node colo setup). 

After further investigation we noticed that the VLAN we were using for the cross colo connection was identifying its root bridge as being on both switches in each datacenter. We resolved this by setting the spanning-tree priority on the VLAN lower on one of the datacenters. It was also recommended that instead of using access ports for the cross datacenter connection we use trunk ports and only allow the particular VLAN across. 

IE: Instead of switchport access vlan 1000 

we were recommended to change the port type to: 

switchport trunk allowed vlan 1000

switchport trunk native vlan 1000 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a very poorly described scenario but would someone be able to explain the difference between an access port and a trunk port where you are only allowing 1 vlan across? Is there a difference or preferred method? 

Lastly, 

Say i have two Cisco Nexus switches in a VPC domain in each datacenter(1 vpc domain per DC). If i am going to set the root bridge priority on one side(IE: Datacenter A) should that priority be specified on both switches in the vpc domain or just the switch the particular link is connected to?

I did a pcap on the client side and the download starts off okay but a few packets in, the client keeps ACK'ing for the same sequence number, which tells me it's not receiving all the data sent by the server. Here's a screen cap with sequence numbers and ACKs underlined: https://imgur.com/a/31jy4W1

This happens frequently throughout the transfer, which results in very slow download speeds. I've tested this from a few different locations globally and most are okay, with only some showing the slower download speeds and exhibiting the same symptoms.

On paper multi-instance tech looks rather good - full separation with independent upgrades, resource allocation and so on. I would have two FTD instances on 4000 series (two HW boxes, active/passive HA between instances), basically one external and one internal firewall. They will be managed by the same staff, but are serving different purpose and splitting them makes sense to me (currently they are two different physical FWs). They can be merged in case there are strong points against multi instance approach and going classic HW active/passive HA.

What I'm worried in case of multi-instance is more or less reliability - instances are rather new feature and are run by docker, which may not come with direct performance penalty, but that's one more layer of complexity and technology that may go wrong.

Examining wireshark capture from another PC on the LAN shows a Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian) is constantly sending icmpv6 neighbor advertisements on the network. Three of them every 8 seconds, to be precise.

As with all NAs the destination is ff02::1

Is this normal behavior? No extra daemons are running on the rpi, it is just a default installation of raspbian. It is the only ipv6 enabled device (homelab) that is doing this.

Hi all, I have a strange problem that I'm hoping to get some input on.

I have a bunch of Azure subscriptions, and a bunch of different pieces of equipment making tunnels to them from different physical locations. Over the last month I've been upgrading all tunnels from the [default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices) Azure IKEv2/IPsec configuration to meet a particular security standard. I do this with a [custom Azure IPsec Policy.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell#managepolicy)

&amp;#x200B;

The default:

IPsecEncryption: AES256

IPsecIntegrity: SHA256

IkeEncryption: AES256

IkeIntegrity: SHA96

DhGroup: DHGroup2

PfsGroup: None

&amp;#x200B;

My new policy:

IPsecEncryption: AES256

IPsecIntegrity: SHA256

IkeEncryption: AES256

IkeIntegrity: ECP256 (this is how Azure refers to group 19)

DhGroup: ECP256 (group 19)

PfsGroup: ECP256 (group 19)

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I have completed this upgrade successfully with about 10 tunnels, mostly with Cisco ASAs, but also some Ubiquiti EdgeRouters, and one Ubiquiti USG. It's been easy and smooth.

Now, I'm trying to configure the same thing with a Cisco ISR 4331. The problem I'm running into, is that the ISR doesn't seem to be honoring my new ""Tunnel protection ipsec profile.""

I have configured the below on my ISR, and then I put the custom IPsec policy in place on the Azure side. The tunnel drops. If I remove the custom IPsec policy from Azure, but LEAVE THE CONFIGURATION ON THE ISR, the tunnel establishes... uses the old default settings. How is this possible?

If I run ""show crypto ikev2 sa"" and ""show crypto ipsec sa"" I see the tunnel established with the old crypto settings. How is this possible when I have configured my new IPsec profile with ""tunnel protection ipsec profile MynewStuff"" ??? Is the ISR allowed to ignore that if something is wrong? I'm very confused. Am I missing a step here? I have tried clearing the SAs after reapplying the custom ipsec profile in Azure, but the tunnel just wont establish until I remove it, and allow it to use the defaults, which the ISR should see as a mismatch.

I'm in IOS XE 16.09.05. Very grateful for any help or insight you might have. Thanks.

Edit: After much pain and learning how to properly debug, the issue is that the Tunnel Interface is indeed trying to negotiate using the old IPsec profile. Waiting to attempt a reboot to see if that clears it. That old IPsec profile has been DELETED at this point, so this is strange.

!!!SOLVED!!! After a reboot, the desired tunnel came up right away... but NONE OF THE OTHER TUNNELS.

The Stentofon won't register in CUCM. I’ve tried deleting the device from Call Manager, factory resetting and reconfiguring the Stentofon, recreating it in Call Manager, and then adding the device back to the network and am not having any luck.

It should be noted we are on Call Manager version 11, although I don’t think there are in functional differences that would affect this particular situation. In addition to that, I’ve tried mimicking the configurations of our other functional devices, both on the Call Manager and the device itself, and haven’t had any luck. 

I can rule out device and network issues. I've run through troubleshooting for both. I've tried configuring the switchport as voice vlan, as well as access and trunk. For the record the other functional Stentofons are in voice. 

I can give more details of necessary, but I figured I might be shooting into the dark here anyway. Let me know if you have any tips or tricks. Much appreciated!",Does anybody have experience using Zenitel Stentofones on Cisco UCM?,r/networking,0.77,9,5,{},0
676,t3_fur8k4,"I’ve got a design issue that I think should be straight forward but I’m just failing to implement here. Network diagram is https://imgur.com/a/9j1UaTP. 

I have two sites, site A and site B each with a connection to the internet connected to a Palo Alto firewall. The Palo Alto then connects to a Cisco 3650 and our own fibre connects the two. We then have a number of satellite sites connected through various media which results in a more circuitous route from site A to B. 

At the moment everything runs through Site A. The Palo Alto advertises a default route through OSPF and the rest of our network is EIGRP. The connections to the ISPs are static routes. I just want to have the Site B internet connection as a backup if A fails but also be able to use both if there’s a complete failure of the routes from A to B such as a fibre cut. 

What would be the best way of doing this? Should I move the default route back off the Palo and onto the Ciscos instead? Should I bring up a direct link between the Palo Altos and use SLA tracking? Any help is greatly appreciated.",ISP failover across two sites,r/networking,0.9,25,24,{},0

We have a fairly mature and stable production ACI system for our intranet server infrastructure, and I was wondering if I could extend this to our DMZ servers.  All of the traffic forwarding between DMZ tiers would be handled by firewalls.  ACI switch fabric would be doing purely L2 and L2-extension.  Zero routing and no contracts.  Also, all of the AppProf/EPG/VRF/BD would be contained within a separate tenant in ACI as well.

I would rather not stand up a whole separate fabric for this, and the stretched layer2 would be critical for delivering dmz capability where there's lack of internet infrastructure.

I am planning to follow the instructions [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/800-series-routers/12065-pswdrec-827.html). As I've never touched a Cisco device in my life, I'm a bit gun-shy so I would like to first attempt a backup with `copy startup-config tftp:` after doing my `copy startup-config running-config` when I'm in privileged mode after setting the `confreg 0x2142`. Maybe that's overkill?...but I'd feel better knowing I have a backup of the current config before I touched anything else.

The problem I'm running into now is this: The documentation linked above only refers to resetting the `enable` password. But when I console into the router, I'm first seeing a `Username:` prompt. From what I'm able to understand via Google, it looks like the person who set up the router also created a ""local login"" account? And that is separate from the ""privileged"" mode password?

Now I'm lost as to see *what* the username is....(a way to list all users?). I'm also confused as to what is needed now in terms of *recovery*. I need to recover both the `enable` password and the username/password for this ""local login"" account?

It would be greatly appreciated if someone here could guide me as to what is needed to simply console into this router, reset all the username/password(s), while also keeping all of the config in-tact (preferably with a backup from the start).",Cisco 881 router - username/password recovery,r/networking,0.6,1,10,{},0

I'd like to get StrongSwan working with a Fortigate unit. The VPN tunnel uses ikev1 with certs and then xauth. So that's an easy leftauth=pubkey, leftauth2=xauth. Well, no.. That just doesn't work. It gets stuck, the firewall cannot find the sent cert it messes up.

which eventually lands

As can be seen, auth\_method should only be rsa\_sig and not rsa\_sig\_xauth\_i. Which is only leftauth=pubkey. But that also doesn't work as then StrongSwan neither responds to xauth requests nor does it send on its own.

Now back to the working Forticlient debug log (on fw):

    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: initiating XAUTH.
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: sending XAUTH request
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: enc

    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: received XAUTH_USER_PASSWORD length 16

Which again is quite f#\*&amp;n odd... It seems like Fortigate FW sends XAUTH request, Forticlient doesn't respond and then yet it just sends XAUTH on its own? Despite its initial type=AUTH\_METHOD, val=RSA\_SIG ???

&amp;#x200B;

Seems absolutely out of spec for me.. Is there any way I can get StrongSwan behave that way? Or any other open source client for that matter. So again. FW is configured to use cert for auth and then xauth (via ldap integration)

You can check the [RIPE Stat widget](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/routing-history#w.resource=216.158.168.1&amp;w.starttime=2015-11-17T00%3A00%3A00&amp;w.endtime=2020-04-02T00%3A00%3A00) or this [snapshot](https://i.imgur.com/ulz0gjm.png). AS209 started advertising the prefix only in March 2020.

It's essentially a very stripped down version of OpenGears's ACM7004-2-L. The device only has two console ports and an LTE antenna. The cost is around ~$150 per device + $10/m for LTE.

In brief:
I'm working with the new Aruba CX switch line. 802.1q ports (which are now called 'trunks' again! LAGs are now called LAGs!) can have a ""Native Untagged vlan"" or a ""Native Tagged vlan"".  

Native Untagged vlan: Exactly what you'd expect.

    interface 1/1/5
      no shutdown
      no routing
      vlan trunk native 60
      vlan trunk allowed all  

Inbound untagged frames are accepted into vlan 60. All tagged frames are accepted.
Oubound frames are all tagged, except for vlan 60 frames, which are always untagged.

Native Tagged vlan:  

    interface 1/1/5
      no shutdown
      no routing
      vlan trunk native 60 tag
      vlan trunk allowed all  

Inbound untagged frames are DROPPED. Inbound frames must be tagged to be accepted, even on the native vlan.
Outbound frames are tagged. Outbound frames on the native vlan, vlan 60, are tagged.

Why is that a ""Native Tagged vlan"" and not ""no native vlan""? I was originally considering BPDUs and STP... but no. If there's a difference there, I'm not seeing it yet. (Disclaimer: I'm using an OVA, not a real switch...)

Oh, and since I brought it up, LAGs are something like...

     interface lag 1                 ; Space required between 'lag' and '1'. Grr.
       lacp mode active
     interface 1/1/1
       lag 1
     interface 1/1/2
       lag 1

Pipe support in show commands...

     switch# show running-config | include ""vlan"" | exclude ""vlan2"" | count
     5
     switch#

You can | include, exclude, count, begin, and redirect.

Interfaces can be 'shut' and 'no shut' instead of 'dis' and 'no dis'.

Who's up on LLDP? 'show lldp neigh' now does the trick, no more 'show lldp info remo'

My boss tasked me with creating the required infrastructure to work from home.  


Now, my job has multiple locations that need to be connected, but, i also need to separate them so someone from location A can't connect to location B and vice-versa, also, there should be good security.  


Now, we have a rack in a datacenter and badass internet, so, my plan is as follows:  
Setup 2 VPN servers, one that does the client (VPN A), the other does the destination (VPN B), there's a username and password plus authorised MAC address and a certificate just to be on the safe side.  
Everyone connects to  VPN A, and based on the input data (user+pass+MAC+cert), it forwards the connection to VPN B that makes the final tunnel to the destination.

Because this is unplanned, i have to deal with the employee's home computers as most of them didn't get laptops, and i was thinking that VPN A would accept 3 protocols: L2TP, SSTP and OpenVPN. VPN B will connect to the location over OpenVPN. If you wonder, L2TP and SSTP is more for compatibility, as it has to deal with vastly different configurations and mobile phones.  


As for volume, i expect about 250 people to use it at the same time, and about 5mb/s internet bandwidth per user should be enough, as they need just remote desktop, our network is fully capable to handle this ammount of traffic.

In terms of functionality and access control everything is working perfectly fine however there is one small issue that has been annoying me (and the handful of users testing the VPN connection) for a while now.

After closing nad restarting the Anyconnect client the ""Connect to"" field is always auto-filled with ""fwvpn (IPsec) IPv4"" instead of the vpn URL used to actually connect. ""fwvpn"" ist the first Hostname that i gave the ASA when i did the first time setup to enable ssh access, interfaces, etc. In the grand scheme of things this isn't actually a real problem as you can simply erase that and retype the URL you want, but i has been irritation nonetheless. 

Does anyone know where this field is from (only time ""fwvpn"" shows up in the config is the self signed certificate used for ASDM on the management interface) ?

I‘m currently working on a GRE tunnel solution for ZScaler with 4 tunnels from two routers behind a FW that does NAT. I build a lab to test everything but my GRE tunnels don’t behave as expected. They show on two routers (the ZScaler side) up/up but are up/down on the enterprise side. I have keepalives in place and the IPs of the enterprise routers are static NATed to “public IPs”. [Here is the  Topology](https://imgur.com/uUwVFML)  with NAT rules and translations, which seem good to me. And here is the config of Tunnel61, between Router 6 and Router 1.

There is OSPF active, but thats only for reachability in the local site. R4 (which connects both sites) doesn't have OSPF active. Just for clarification.

Edit 3

I think it is because the Keepalive packets of R6 and R3, can't be routed back from R1 or R2 to R6 or R3. Because in the Keepalive Message, the outerheader will be NATed and arrives, from R6, at R1. But R1 decapsulates it and tries to send the keepalive back to [10.180.6.6](https://10.180.6.6) (the source interface in R6). But this is a private IP and R1 will never be able to reach that IP over the internet. There should be the public IP of R6 ([10.10.14.6](https://10.10.14.6)).

Edit 4

Ok, right now the tunnels work, but only without keepalives. The keepalives are what the line protocol keeps down (as intended, if they don't work). I also added the MTU 1400, MSS 1360 and mtu path discovery on the Tunnels. Everything works. 

But as soon as the keepalives are active, the tunnels in the enterpriese (R6, R3) change the line protocol to down. Because there is no way to route traffic from R1 (ZScaler) to the source IP of R6 (private IP in Enterprise). And that makes sense to me, but how do I get those keepalives to work? I think I need to NAT the inner header in the keepalive packets..  ",GRE Tunnel issue I can‘t get my head around,r/networking,0.67,4,18,{},0

That's tells me it's either not offered, or so standard that it's not even listed, haha. I'm not familiar enough with the technology to know what to look for.

Secondly, any recommendations? We need something with a desktop application, rather than just a mobile app like Grasshopper. Like I said, the only other real feature we need is for it to ring on all endpoints so that any one of our employees can answer it.

721,t3_ftdeup,"Does anyone here know how best to handle these? Specifically the /30ish subnet between the routers? All the BGP guides I find are somewhat generic and always discourage advertising these into BGP itself but never explain why. They mention using an IGP, loopback &amp; static routes, and I do understand how all of that works; but what is recommended in real life scenarios?

I know you can use an IGP to handle this but I am interested in how ISPs connect their iBGP routers.

For example, one datacenter I manage has a BGP session with 2 different ISPs to 2 of my routers. Cogent to router A &amp; Hurricane Electric to router B. They each gave me a small public subnet to peer with them on. These subnets are advertised because they are routable on the Internet. But beyond that I have no idea what ISPs are using to connect routers in their own AS and to external ISPs.

A part 2 to this question would be how ISPs interconnect with each other. I know generally they converge at Internet exchanges with a route reflector/server, but I am interested in the subnets they are using to do this. Are they public and Internet routable?

One last thing. I have 2 different routers, one connected to each ISP (eBGP) and then they were connected to each other (iBGP). They are each getting a partial/default route table from their respective ISP. Instead of using next-hop-self, I simply advertised the /30 into iBGP at each router so they each have an organic route to the next hop ISP router instead of router A announcing itself as the next hop to router B for routes on Cogent.

There are few more widely used implementations like raknet, but those implementations only aim to achieve single goal, making them fit only small set of projects. Using standardized protocol could benefit network programmers, making it so they don't need to create/learn new protocol for every new project they start.

QUIC might be that standard in the future, as it's performing those same functions (reliability and ordering) while staying fast. However, its focus on HTTP makes me wonder if it will stay flexible enough for other applications. I found a paper from 2015 considering its use in multiplayer games, but all in concluded was ""it might be used for that, who knows."" 

I wanted to ask you guys for your thoughts on the matter.",Question about QUIC viability for multiplayer gaming,r/networking,1.0,1,0,{},0

I've ran into a snag that I can't really understand. I'm new to  switching and it's been pretty rough so far.  I picked up the 6610 after  reading through the ICX series sticky thread.  I have all the firmware  on it and its ready to go but configuring it is being a pain.      
 

First I'll say that my router/modem is still on the outside of the  switch, so when accessing the switch to ping it is going through my  routers WIFI, to the LAN port and then to the switch.  At the moment  there is nothing on the other side of the switch.    
 

I am attempting to make 3 different VLANs in the switch VLAN 10 for the  DMZ, VLAN 20 for internal network, and VLAN 30 for management. My router  has the internal network at 10.100.0.0/8.  What I am finding is A) I  cannot ping an interface if the port is tagged, only untagged and B)I  cannot ping the port if the mask on the interface is anything other than  /16.  I was trying to make everything /24.     
 

For instance VLAN 30 is set to 10.100.1.1/16 and I can ping it through  it's 2 ports.   But if I set it to 10.100.1.1/24 it won't.  And if I try  to get around this by then putting VLAN 20 to 10.200.1.1/16 instead of  the 10.100.2.1/24 that I would LIKE to, that won't ping either.

The existing 10/100 ports are split up into VLANs for various client and server groups.  The switch is largely there for routing.  There are a combination of static routes and BGP for our connections to branch offices.  The current north and south connections are all 1Gb Ethernet and a combination of L2 switches from various vendors (Dell, HP, Cisco whatever was available when others purchased).  The configuration on this switch rarely changes.  I'm talking one config change every 3-5 years.  For this reason, it's gone largely ignored.

I'm hoping to change that with a core switch upgrade and have a few questions.  

We are a medium size business.  We are very flexible on budget.  I want something that is easy to configure, deploy, and maintain going forward, so that it doesn't go ignored in the future.  I have plenty of networking experience, so am comfortable configuring a Cisco, even if I haven't had to do so in over a decade.  My only lack of experience is with managing BGP, as it's something I rarely have to engage.

1.  Cisco site is recommending the upgrade path from a 3560 to the 9300.  Does this upgrade path sound fair, overkill, or lacking?
2. With this upgrade path, would I likely be able to copy the config line for line on to the 3560, reducing configuration and implementation time. 
3. There was a previous concern among the decision makers that Cisco licensing is difficult and overpriced.  Is that true nowadays?

Tried to make a gliffy as well: [https://imgur.com/a/lKfjn03](https://imgur.com/a/lKfjn03) 

  
**Description**

Currently, BGP from AWS advertises [10.0.0.0/16](https://10.0.0.0/16) successfully to my Juniper SRX, and traffic flows as expected with the VPN tunnel established.

In the AWS VPC, I have set up a OpenVPN server in EC2. It has a elastic public ip associated to it, and it sits in the subnet [10.0.0.0/24](https://10.0.0.0/24).

When I configured OpenVPN, I set the OpenVPN tunnel subnet to be [10.1.100.0/24](https://10.1.100.0/24).  
This was chosen as you cannot specify a route more specific than the VPC CIDR which is [10.0.0.0/16](https://10.0.0.0/16) in the route table.   
The message if you try to specify a more specific route in the route table is *""This route table is used by a subnet, and doesn't support route destination which are more specific than VPC local CIDR.""*  
In the route table, I set up a static route for [10.1.100.0/24](https://10.1.100.0/24) \--- &gt; IP address of the instance hosting the OpenVPN server, in order to get around the above issue.  


When I connect to the OpenVPN server using my laptop (10.1.100.60), I can ping other servers hosted in the VPC, and I can also ping the OpenVPN client (the laptop) from a server hosted in EC2 in the [10.0.0.0/24](https://10.0.0.0/24) subnet. So the routing within the VPC works.

I can also from the laptop, ping my servers hosted on-prem in the subnet [172.21.20.0/24](https://172.21.20.0/24).  
The subnets are propagated to the route table in AWS via BGP.  


My problem is, I cannot send traffic from on-prem ([172.21.20.0/24](https://172.21.20.0/24)) to the OpenVPN clients, since the advertised routes from AWS via BGP is [10.0.0.0/16](https://10.0.0.0/16), and the OpenVPN traffic is using [10.1.100.0/24](https://10.1.100.0/24).  
If I run tcpdump on one of my servers hosted on-prem ([172.21.20.0/24](https://172.21.20.0/24)) while pinging it from the laptop connected via OpenVPN, it send the respond back to the OpenVPN server ([10.0.0.200](https://10.0.0.200)).  


So I know i need to route traffic destined for the subnet [10.1.100.0/24](https://10.1.100.0/24) to the OpenVPN server [10.0.0.200](https://10.0.0.200). That's clear to me.  


However, from the AWS documentation ""*The virtual private gateway does not route any other traffic destined outside of received BGP advertisements, static route entries, or its attached VPC CIDR*"" [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPNRoutingTypes.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPNRoutingTypes.html) 

Does the above have an impact in setting up a static route to the OpenVPN server?

&amp;#x200B;

**How do I route traffic to the OpenVPN tunnel subnet from my on-prem SRX, via the already established AWS VPN tunnel to my VPC?**

\- Can I set up static routing? eg [10.1.100.0/24](https://10.1.100.0/24) \-&gt; [10.0.0.207](https://10.0.0.207). My brain is having a hard time understanding the language of the AWS documentation listed above.   
I did a test already, but I could not get it to play along. I did this on the SRX: set routing-options static route [10.1.100.0/24](https://10.1.100.0/24) next-hop [10.0.0.207](https://10.0.0.207)  
I think this does not work due to the IP adress of the OpenVPN server, [10.0.0.207](https://10.0.0.207) is not reachable from within the SRX itself as its using a 169. address.([https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=48379](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=48379))  
Show route [10.1.100.0](https://10.1.100.0) tells me that it's still routed by the route 0.0.0.0/0  


\- Did I shoot myself in the foot, and need to redesign the the whole VPC and network (if so, how should I do it instead?)

I've been stuck with this topic for a while and not sure where to go next. If anyone can point me in a direction I would be very grateful. I have very little experience in this type of ""deep dive"" network troubleshooting. 

F5 support has told me the issue is ""between the F5 and the VM"", which doesn't help much since the connection goes F5 &lt;-&gt; Switch &lt;-&gt; Hyper-V Clusters. The switch is managed by our datacenter provider while we own both the F5 and the Hyper-V Clusters.

What happens is that we will have intermittent timeouts of connections to the F5 that I have yet been unable to reproduce reliably. At random intervals, accessing one of our virtual servers will time out. Sometimes this happens 10 times in a row, most of the time it will work fine immediately after. My next step would have been to see if this issue occurs on infrastructure other than our clusters. They are both configured exactly the same so the issue could be existent on them both.

756,t3_fsjiyo,"I'm helping a buddy of mine clean up his company's corporate network, and the most importan aspect I recommended was to divide into VLANs. Everything was on a flat address space (**192.168.1.0/24**) and obviously this presented many issues.

The entire network is based on UniFi hardware and Windows AD DCs acting as DHCP and DNS servers.

I've successfully separated IP cameras, printers, workshop machinery and devices and employee's mobile phones into their own VLANs. Different SSIDs for gust Wi-Fi is also in place. 

Now, what's left are the Windows servers and client PCs. As I mentioned, there are two DCs acting as DHCP and DNS servers, currently offering IP addresses only to domain joined PCs, as every other device gets an IP directly form the USG. This is working perfectly fine although every computer in the domain can see every server when going to Network in Windows Explorer. 

Both DCs have a scope setup in the **192.168.1.0** range. It's split up 80/20 so both are offering addresses. The same goes for the DNS Reverse Lookup Zones, each one has the **1.168.192.in-addr.arpa** zone.

I created a new VLAN subnet in UniFi with **192.168.40.0/24** to place all client PCs there. DHCP was set to Relay pointing to the current servers.

My questions are:

1.	Should I create a new scope in the DHCP servers for the **192.168.40.1** space? Should I add a second Ethernet adapter to listen on the new scope?
2.	Should I also create a new primary zone in DNS for it?

I want the DCHP and DNS servers in **192.168.1.0** to serve all clients in **192.168.40.0**.

Would this be OK or am I giving the wrong advice? It's been a while since I setup DHCP and DNS on Windows Servers.

I am troubleshooting an SCCM multicast issue for a client and wanted to confirm something before I look at the SCCM configuration and server specs.

There is no requirement to.

The switches are all Cisco 3650 switches with IGMP Snooping enabled but default.

My question - Will IGMP Snooping work without a router? I've done a little research and it seems that an IGMP Snooping Querier is required in the absence of a Multicast Router. 

Is this correct? If so, do I need to configure only a single SVI on a single switch as an IGMP querier? Or do I need to configure a querier on all switches within the domain.

Is there any additional config I should be aware of to optimise multicast traffic?

765,t3_fs4lv9,"Hey folks- network engineer here, looking for some help reverse-engineering how this (really powerful) free service works. The site I am talking about is [ipv4info.com](http://ipv4info.com) and the unique ability it provides is a searchable database by keyword (for organization, contact, etc, etc) for even the most tiny of network allocations.

**FIRST:** *If you suspect I am about to spam you to sell a service, please see the last line of the post and also read the content here carefully and judge for yourself; you can no longer pay for data from this site, and it seems to be moribund and not making any revenue off of any obvious advertising (though I guess the traffic rankings do boost the value- whatever...)*

***SECOND****: If you still thinking I'm spamming you / advertising but you have some helpful technical answers for me about how it might work, feel free to send me a direct message if you don't feel comfortable potentially sending more traffic to this site*

**THIRD:** *If anyone is able to help me figure out how this works, I'm happy to put up a clone as a free service and open-source the tooling/backend- though the fact that it's shutting down and based in Russia makes me wonder if it is up to something that can be considered a ""gray-area"" ...* 

... back to the point. I am very aware of whois/rwhois. I pull down the latest rwhois raw database files from all of the RIRs (ARIN, APNIC, LACNIC, ...) every night over FTP, parse them out, and do some searching based on keywords for some organizations that I work on contract for to provide them data on their Internet assets when they need third-party verification of ""inventory""

What I found at this specific site when I stumbled upon it just a few months ago (which is apparently defunct, not taking new customers, and *starting* to have stale data) is a bunch of /28, /29 and /30 CIDR blocks that can't be found via any paid or free service I've been able to find over the years. This includes searching via the individual RIRs themselves using their keyword search mechanisms as a I mentioned.

I'm wondering how the heck it is possible that they have this data ***in this keyword searchable format.*** I understand I can always rwhois an IP address and get back the fields that contain keywords that I am looking for (e.g. the name of a customer's business) but for that you obviously need to know the IP address first. So, chicken and egg. And I'm not going to try to actively whois every IP on the Internet and get banned from every rwhois service before I get .05% through. I figure even excluding RFC1918 addresses, there's just too much search space since you have to search within the larger blocks to discover these smaller ones. Brute force searching just doesn't seem feasible unless it's part of some hybrid approach

To be clear- ***I am not talking about a standard searchable ASN database site***\- these are a dime a dozen and I've been using them for years. I'm not even talking about the equally common sites/services that let you find smaller CIDR blocks, typically /25 and larger via keyword searches. None of these sites turn up the networks that this site finds.

**Example:** As an example of how this is different, go to the ARIN site and search for ""Exxon"" **(AND NO, I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH EXXON EITHER!)**

Using ARINs keyword search, You'll be able to track down a handful of their network blocks, especially a few of their big ones. Great. Now go to the site I mentioned in the first paragraph and type ""Exxon"". The networks it returns is significantly longer and contains a relatively large amount of really small networks, down to /30. These obviously are not all Exxon corporate- but at least a few are probably small Exxon corporate remote sites, maybe egress points, out of band management for DR, or surveillance gear. They are not all just random little gas stations or loosely affiliated entities. I guess Exxon wasn't a great example, but still, it works to demonstrate the point.

*Can anyone speculate as to how they are getting this data in such a way that it is searchable by keyword?*

After talking to a few friends, some ideas came up about monitoring for route announcements passively, then performing some active rwhois queries, and then continuously updating via this basic approach. But none of us are quite sure if this is actually practical.

I'm not necessarily looking for an equivalent service/site (though I would be very interested if there were any) but I am very interested in figuring out how they do this as it would help me in my work quite a bit- these small networks are often not well known to the organizations that are responsible for them, and they end up being the source of an outage or a security incident eventually, so having them discoverable so easily is really significant.

Before jumping to any conclusions and telling me that this site/service provides no unique capability, please give it a shot with any large international corporation as an example- find a small block (maybe a /29) see if you can find it via a keyword search on ARIN's site or ARINs rwhois DB snapshot files (or any other RIR for that matter) and then do a whois on it to see that the data is in fact correct.

BTW- ***In case anyone suspects I'm advertising for the site,*** I'll point out that it seems to have been a pay service at one time but is no longer accepting payments/subscriptions. It also says that the domain is for sale. It seems to be based in Russia.

I have the Meraki device configured and working.  I can connect to the corporate network using a shared PKI.  However, I am having the hardest time getting RADIUS to work.  I configured the RADIUS settings correctly on the Meraki GUI, so that is not the issue.   Somewhere I am having an issue with either the certificate I am using for PEAP or the NPS server itself.

NPS is setup using a CA we published from our local CA server.  I imported the cert into my RADIUS server and configured the NPS client to match the static IP of my AP.  I then built a Connection Request Policy allowing Wireless devices and a Network Policy requesting that the user be a member of a specific group in Active Directory.  

When I attempt to connect from a domain laptop, I get prompted for my user credentials but the connection fails.  I never get locked out of AD even though the fail limit is set to 3 attempts so I dont think it is ever reaching my AD.

Cisco doesn't give any indication as to why these rules are listed, so I'm hoping to get a bit more insight from you guys out there who've been through SDA deployments in the past.

* I understand a higher MTU is required due to the additional overhead, but does it really require a 9100-byte MTU? Assuming you're not stretching storage over the WAN (these aren't DC interconnects after all...), wouldn't 2000 bytes or so be sufficient?
* Switches don't have the same buffers or traffic shaping capabilities as routers, so I understand why line-rate ethernet is important. But if you connect a Cisco ISR to the WAN as an intermediate SD-Access node, wouldn't this not be a problem?

Note: I'm not personally a fan of this design, but my customer wants it due to the simplicity of management.

Hello,

I own an esports center in Hawaii. We are upgrading our infrastructure to 10g.  
Currently using [Mikrotik CRS309-1G-8S+IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs309_1g_8s_in) for the main fiber switch in our rack. running SwitchOS  
I have 10GB SFP+ fiber modules going to each of my tables.  
Each table has this switch on it [CSS326-24G-2S+RM](https://mikrotik.com/product/CSS326-24G-2SplusRM)

Fiber runs in feet for each table  
Table 1 85ft  
Table 2 65ft  
Table 3 50ft  
Table 4 50ft

Before I was strictly using the fiber switch as my main switch I had a trendnet smart switch. that fed to each table through cat 6.

On my personal computer, I have a 2.5G ethernet on the motherboard. And a 10gb NIC on our server.

When transferring while using the trendnet as the main ""trunk"" (it's not set up as a trunk, just using the term) it would transfer from server to my computer at 110MB/s

Now with the fiber in play, I can only transfer from the server to my computer at 55MB/s max

is there something I am missing?

My computer is set up on table 2. This switch has a 10gb fiber coming in on SFP+1 and my computer is connected through a 10GB SFP+ copper RJ45 module on SFP+ 2.  
On the server, it has a SATA 3 SSD. On my computer, I'm transferring it to a PCIe Gen4 corsair m.2 NVME SSD. I tried using jumbo frame on both clients. that made it worse.

I am not sure if its a setting issue. or a fiber issue.  
on the Main switch, the fiber is showing  
36C -- 3.278V --- 5mA Tx bias --- -1.651dBm Tx power --- -2.444dBm Rx Power

On the table switch, it is showing  
41C --- 3.234V --- 6mA Tx bias --- -2.432dBm Tx power --- -2.499dBm Rx Power

I went through all my fiber today, and did a wet rub and dry rub, with the cleaning wipes provided in the bag of fiber. it didn't change any of the rx/tx power",Mikrotik 10gb network,r/networking,0.7,13,34,{},0

I'm trying to make sure a specific IKEv2 policy is used for a Tunnel on an ISR 4000 series. I'm having trouble, after reading the documentation and lots of examples online, whether this statement can match the Tunnel's ""ip address"" or if it will try to match on the external local address.

For example:

Lets say on my ""interface tunnelX"", I have ""tunnel protection ipsec profile XXX\_NAME""

Then on my ipsec profile I have ""set ikev2-profile XXX\_NAME""

My understanding is that I can't really define my IKEv2 policy (which defines my proposal) anywhere in here, it just gets selected based on best match. I have a lot of similar tunnels, but I want to make sure it selects the exact one. I think I can do this with ""match address local"" command when modifying the IKEv2 policy. 

\#crypto ikev2 policy XXX\_MYNAMEGOESHERE

\#match address local XXXX (I would put the ip address defined on ""interface tunnel X - ip address ""XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"" here)

Now obviously, the IP I want to put in here is the IP address I defined under ""interface tunnelX &gt; ip address X,"" because all of my tunnels use the same ""tunnel source"" IP address, which is my public IP.

Will this work, or the ""match address local"" statement use the ""tunnel source XXXXX"" IP address of the tunnel interface?

\- Connections in to the network are fine. I can connect in using SSL VPN. I can also connect to services inside the network from outside (CCTV)

\- Once in, I cannot get any traffic originating inside the network to pass out. I cannot ping [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) from any device that I could previously.

\- From the 2400 I can however ping [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and my ISP DNS servers.

I'm hopeful that nobody has changed anything today but I'm at a loss to try and understand what has happened?! Networking is not my area of expertise unfortunately, and I'm struggling for any resource internally to help.

798,t3_fs1tpq,"so this may sound a little crazy, but this has happened to me so many times that i am starting to think this is intentional.....

TL;DR at the bottom

I work in a fairly large location, that has roughly 100 or so ""remote"" sites around the state that all VPN back to the main office. Those VPN connected remote sites all use various ISP's to connect back to the main office. I am continuously having issues with 5 of the same spectrum sites (geographically diverse). We have other spectrum sites that are behaving normally.

These sites will start to get really high ping delay alerts from our monitoring tools. this started happening a few months ago. the first time it happened, i jumped right on the phone with spectrum once I realized all the sites had a common ISP. While on hold waiting to speak with someone, these locations all cleared up. The alerts stopped, the graphs went back to normal. Spoke with a rep anyway, and of course they saw no issue on their end. the time between the issue occurring and me calling, and the problem going away is about an hour total.

a few days go by, and the alerting and ping delays start to go crazy again. i call, and shortly after entering my account number in the automated system....everything returns to normal....strange. Still spoke with a rep, and they say ""nothing on our end; everything looks good""; again total time between alerts and call, about an hour.

a few weeks later, it happens again, alerts going crazy, users are not complaining, so i let it go. I just watch the alerts as does the rest of my team. this time, we wait 3-4 hours before we call again....as soon as we call, everything goes back to normal....WTF......

Now cut to the last 2 weeks......we have seen a ton of these start up again. We sort of expected some issues, with lots of people working from home, etc. These 5 sites started up with a vengeance alerting day and night. Giving up on spectrum being the issue, We engaged our firewall vendor, looked at our edge routers, captured logs, scheduled maintenance window reboots on some core pieces of equipment, and still these alerts keep coming in just for these 5 sites. These locations would alert for almost 2 weeks straight, with some nights and weekends where things would calm down slightly. I finally had enough of the alerting and opted to call spectrum on Friday afternoon and asked to have a ticket escalated.  You guessed it.....Friday afternoon, all our issues and alerting stopped shortly after placing the phone call. We have not had a single alert since.

At this point, I am 100% convinced they are playing a shell game with services, and shifting those that call to complain to a better QoS pool or something. Has anyone experienced anything like this with spectrum? Any insight anyone could provide, would be greatly appreciated.

looking for some help, got cisco asa5525 firepower in HA, in prod, all working etc etc.

With recent wfh, anyconnect in place and happily working as expected. However for some reason I cannot reach one of the networks that sits on a site2site vpn, other sites work fine, its a single hub HA with multiple spokes if that changes anything.

Now, I am forced to use a nat rule to present outbound traffic as something else, this is due to their lack of response to changing thier inbound subnet rules, anyway, it works fine as expected internally.

I checked s2s subnets, checked include split tunnel on anyconnect, created dedicated nat rule just for anyconnect traffic.

asa packet tracer shows no issues, it hits through the nat rules as expected and forwards packet as expected with no rules or otherwise blocking it. however I still can't even get a ping going.

800,t3_fr9sco,"Hi, so in everyone's opinion or having already seen this in their jobs already....when do you think the Cisco CLI will almost completely be null and void? 
I've read so many things on this with experts saying this like SDN and Python will totally replace it but in what time frame are we looking at here...months...years or even longer?
Will things like the CLI for things like the ASA's, Nexus switches, Routers and switches be completely discontinued? And if so when?
I've never worked with SDN before (although I do plan to take up Python soon after I've finished somemore learning) but I'm struggling to see how things like python would interact with an ASA or the CLI on it? Would you start writing the config in python or write a script in python to then go and push out commands on the ASA? 
Or am I totally overthinking this and things like ASA's, Nexus switches, routers and normal switches will always be around for many years to come or never totally be gone?
I've come across some senior engineers who don't want anything to do with SDN yet and are happy with the CLI and the normal way things are and don't want to change to. I know the old saying ""change is good"" but in this case I guess I'm just curious, I've spent the last 3-4 years and dedicated a big part of my life to learn everything networking and I got my CCNP in Feb 2018, which I plan on renewing soon as well.

The information I am looking to extract is pretty simple, I just need the tcp streams present and the total # of bytes transferred in each stream. The output of 'tshark -r capture.pcapng -n -q -z conv,tcp' is pretty much exactly what I am looking to get. Unfortunately, the issue I am faced with is that I need to gather this output for hundreds of pcaps and synthesize them into one report. Normally I would merge the capture files together quickly and use tshark to do this, but in this case I am looking at 100s of pcaps amounting to over a TB altogether. Have any networking gurus out there been faced with a similar issue, or does anyone know of any open-source tools that could prove useful in accomplishing this?

This means that as long as a router is online it will advertise any prefix that is defined by configuration regardless if that prefix is actually in routing table or not.  For example if we have an interface with the ip 10.0.0.1/24 and a network statement [10.0.0.0/24](https://10.0.0.0/24) and that interface fails, the router will continue to advertise [10.0.0.0/24](https://10.0.0.0/24).

831,t3_gjlfud,"We intend to replace our current 'core' switch. It has 12x SFP+ ports which are used to link to other switches and 2x physical servers (VMware ESXi hosts). We are currently at max capacity on it, and want to move away from a single point of failure (understandably...).

I say 'core' because I don't know a better word. That switch is definitely a SPOF currently, and concerning. All traffic must go though it to get to the servers (2x VMware ESXi hosts) and by extension the FortiGate VM.
We're not really big enough to have real defined areas of the network as core, distribution and access. All 'access' switches are directly connecting to this current 'core' switch.

Currently using a 'router on a stick' type network with inter-VLAN routing being handled by a ForitGate VM on the VMware cluster. I would like to move to inter-VLAN routing being managed by L3 switches, but currently the 'access' switches are managed L2. Only the current 'core' switch is L3. The FortiGate's 'IPv4 Policy' also gives us a better control than L3 ACLs, although at a major throughput disadvantage compared to L3 routing.

We need a solution to replace the current 'core' switch, one that will handle at least 48 SFP+ connections, to allow for two links per switch and server, and for growth room.

Currently thinking about 2x Aruba 3810M 24SFP+ 250W Switch (JL430A), if that switch is suitable we'd probably run one link from each switch / server to each of the switches, then maybe 2x links from each 3810M to each ESXi server.

Another option is using just one switch, but 48x SFP+ ports on it and redundant internal controllers? IE firmware upgrades or 1x control module failure etc result in no network downtime. Then using link aggregation on that switch to the other devices.

I have used simple link aggregation before to connect switches to the current 'core' switch, and understand having an actually redundant path is a lot better, as with link aggregation you still have the SPOF by using 1 switch (unless it's dual controller).

I'm not a networking expert, but I'm well acquainted with VLANs, firewalls policies and routers etc. I haven't needed to modify spanning tree settings on any devices so far, so will definitely need to do some more learning on it before I start looking into changing this network to make it actually redundant. I've never worked with BGP, OSPF etc. I know there are far more complex protocols for managing networks with multiple paths, but what would you recommend I do in this scenario?

832,t3_gjm6y5,"Hi Folks, I'm representing a network solution architect team in huge country-wide organization with numerous (~1000) branch offices and reseller points. Yes, we going to migrate an old setup with newer approaches and tech in mind. Currently we have a mixture of IPsec/OpenVPN/ugly RA and site-to-site connections.
We have redundant RASes distributed over few locations. The whole idea is to provide access to some Central services (hosted in AWS) and have access from HQ to particular IP-ready equipment in remote location. That's the baseline we have now.

The way this network operates now is less efficient you might think . There is numerous outages, fat finger mistakes, HW failures, long restoration time, and much manual config required on remote side (I meant both remote hands and central initiated provisioning).

We going to build new implementation which involves few new concepts (SDN), techniques (DCI, VXLAN) and technologies (OvS/WireGuard/EVPN) . In general we going to create an overlay on top of existing underlay backbone, and soon decommission old gateway hardware. We'll start with shipping appliances which will host kvm/docker images with preinstalled software which going to build up connection to out HQ. Then we will use this appliance as reverse-proxy for accessing remote resources and finally will switch on-premise to use appliance as main GW. Most remote locations has internet-routable ipv4 address, so appliance will serve also as NAT GW (needed bw is very small).

Here is summary of connect requirements we've defined:
1. automation provisioning of RA outbound tunnel (remote side is requester)
2. direct IP connectivity inside created overlay (branch to HQ and vice-versa) (VRouter functionality)
3. possibility to isolate and to grant spoke-to-spoke flows
4. ability to tunnel L2 to remote location
5. ability to tunnel trunk with 10 VID to remote location
6. appliance redundancy for SW components (HA inside host kvm)
7. cryptography to secure tunnel creation

So, finally a questions part:
 - what open-source software products you can suggest (OvS)?
 - what SDN controller to use (we looking at Tungsten Fabric, old OpenContrai from Juniper)?
 - what CI/CD stack to implement (ansible/terraform)
 - what proactive monitoring approach to use

The morning of the event, my boss Slacked me to make sure the whole team showed up, so I figured our CEO was going to give us a nod. He has mentioned us a few times since this shutdown began.

The Town Hall continued much as it usually does, until we got to the Awards section. There amongst the list of nominees was me, but much more ""surprise and delight""fully **and importantly** was 'IT Team'.

A huge amount of work has gone in over the last year and a half, and having the team recognized in this way was a real moment of pride for all of us. The best part of it was that the biggest nomination was from our CEO's EA, who had historically had a terrible relationship with IT, and now here she was, nominating all of us for an award.

I started writing this post and realized it was going to be a long one, so TL;DR is above. The story of getting from zeroes to heroes follows ...

\-----

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized. I'm mainly trying to decide if it's something I just accept and fudge the numbers like im told is common practice (track 30 min blocks of time and just split up the 8 hours however you feel on whichever tickets you worked on), or if maybe it's time to update my resume as it's as uncommon as I think, a sign of distrust and potentially worse things to come.",Is Sysadmin time tracking a thing?,r/sysadmin,0.79,19,57,{},1

We recently got a storage cage (SAS) for archive data for our SIEM. This cage has 10 HDDs (not sure the speed) that are each 10TB each. They are 7200 RPM. I've never configured a storage unit with drives this large before and I am not sure what best practices to follow here.

It seemed like RAID-6 was recommended; however, the article I am reading is for 2.4TB drives. Should I be looking at something even faster than RAID-6, such as RAID-60 or even RAID-10?

852,t3_gfsp9z,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

Three typical tiers on the system; sql data, application and web tiers.  All running on one server but due to growth and need for more secutity, I have developed a potential topology along with the vendor, to segregate all three tiers in their own subnet.  The web and application tiers will sit in a dmz which needs to be internet exposed.  Sql can live in a more protected subnet.

My issue is how to proceed with active directory and domain membership.  I am identifying 2 problems thus far:

1.  The web and application systems in the dmz need to write to a windows file share on the sql servers.  
2. All systems in all three tiers need to be members of the same domain to permit utilization of domain resources.

It was one thing where everything was combined in the same server and on one subnet, with a local domain controller.  Now with different subnets of varying security, I have web and application servers in a dmz but the domain controller in the trusted, probably next to the sql server in its own subnet.

Ive read some case studies and they range from not adding the dmz servers to AD and using local account (yechhhh!).  Or a completely separate domain for AD for servers in the DMZ and another one for the sql system in the trusted LAN.  Ive stumbled upon AD federation and its a bit new to me, still reading about it and dont know if its the proper tool for me.

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS currently.  This is a test virtual server.

I am trying to use realmd to connect to Active Directory and I am successfully joining but running into issues which seem to be related to group enumeration ( and as a result, authentication issues for users trying to connect via SSH, I will explain)..

Here is the method I used to join the domain (subbing out the actual domain name for 'domain'):

    yum install -y realmd 
    yum upgrade -y
    realm discover domain.local
    yum install -y &lt;packagename&gt;....   # after running realm discover it will display necessary package dependencies, I've installed them all.
    sudo apt install packagekit
    
    realm join --user=domain_admin --computer-ou='&lt;Valid OU for computer object&gt;' --os-name='Ubuntu' DOMAIN.LOCAL
    
    reboot
    
    vi /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
      -  I set 'use_fully_qualified_names = false'
      -  I set 'fallback_homedir = /home/DOMAIN/%u'
    systemctl restart sssd

The domain has an AD security group, ""srv-servername-ssh"" and if you are a part of that AD security group, you are permitted to log in via SSH.   I use sshd\_config on my servers to specify (via AllowGroups) certain AD groups which are permitted to SSH to the box.   This works, as long as the system realizes the user trying to log in is part of a valid group.

My issue is: in most cases, if I try to perform this command..

    id user1

..it recognizes the AD user, but returns only a few groups (usually only returns 'domain users' group, very rarely returns the membership list).

If I try typing the following, I can see the full group membership:

    getent group srv-servername-ssh

I am lost on why this is happening, but it is preventing reliable SSH login for the domain users who are supposed to be able to , since the server usually doesn't recognize the user as being part of a valid (allowed) group for SSH access.  Any idea?

What is planning? Firewall licenses expired, new firewall quickly installed, but not fully configured. Need both running at the same time, on same subnet. Currently cannot connect to any devices pointing to the new gateway when logged into VPN, but can still access devices with the old gateway still statically assigned.

Hey all - been pulling my hair out all day, hoping to get some advice to what I'm overlooking here.

Scenario: SonicWall FireWall is getting replaced by Cisco Meraki FireWall. We were not ready to do the switchover, but licensing expired. We have set up DHCP to point to our Meraki as the Gateway to ensure we're using the licensed content filtering, as our SonicWall CFS expired.

Everything inside our network seems to be fine - users still have internet access, and the content filtering is working.

The problem comes that we're still using our NetExtender VPN licenses, as we haven't done the configuration to get the Cisco Meraki VPN set up with our Active Directory.


The issue we're having is that after the gateway changed in our DHCP and our workstations got the updated gateway, some of our remote users who were using the NetExtender VPN + RDP to get to their desktop are now unable to get to their workstation when the gateway is set to our Cisco Meraki gateway.


Does anyone know what settings I need to adjust to make sure that our NetExtender SSL VPN is able to connect to these machines?

    Gateway 2: 192.168.1.2 -&gt; Points to COAX Connection

currently I am applying to jobs after being a trainee. I never had any real contact with databases in terms of mainting and creating. Sure privately I've setup some mysql oder mariadb database, but the only thing I did was creating a database user and the rest was done by an application.   
I also did some sql statements in school but never had practical use for them.

Now in job descriptions I often see that you should know about (mainly mysql) database and how to maintain them.

Tbh I don't really have a glue what this is about. I doubt its only about creating a database user and thats it :D 

So my questions is what are you guys doing with db in your all day life? And specifically what are database admins doing with them the whole day? What should I learn in my private time to say that I have at least minimal knowledge about maintaining databases etc. (Question mainly is about db running on Linux)

I'm on a small team of contractors who work for multiple clients and are required to submit reports with our monthly invoices. These reports contain a high level overview of the tasks completed or progressed during the month. The reports do not correlate to billable hours or helpdesk tickets. In many cases, tasks are not tied to a helpdesk ticket, and if they are, there are multiple helpdesk systems in play.

Details for each item are fairly minimal:

* Client
* Date requested
* Requestor
* Ticket (if any)
* Description
* Status/completion date

For *over five years*, we have all been compiling this manually in mother-effing Word documents. Yes, *Word.* Lots of copying and pasting, highlighting to remove completed tasks, manually merging weekly reports into monthly reports. It's really terrible.

Due to some recent contract changes, I've been asked to improve upon this. So I'm looking for a solution where:

* 10 users can log in and enter their own work items.
* Users should be able to see ongoing items and add to them.
* Managers should be able to create reports based on status and completion date.

My company has a small client that is running 2008r2, and we were recently approved to upgrade both their physical server as well as their OS. Due to the nature of their business, they cannot afford any downtime during this transition (other than swapping the server and testing). Cost is also a large factor for them. Their server is currently acting as a file server, AD, along with having a program that uses SQL server. The only data we are concerned about is AD and the file server as the other software using SQL server is not needed. Their files are being backed up with Azure and a system image being backed up to another network device. 

1). Would it be worth while to take a copy of the system image, restore it to the new server, and do an in-place upgrade to 2012r2 and then 2019 (We will have the licensing, CALs, etc already taken care of)?

Like many, I started out as a computer repair technician.  Since then, I’ve been a senior sysadmin, architect, and I’m in management now.  I’m still all of those things.

My first paid gig was in the late 90s when everyone was buying their computers with home service warranties.  I’d drive over a 150 mile radius diagnosing and servicing computers. I’d drive out, diagnose the issue, and usually come back a few days later once the identified part came in.  I got paid by the visit.  A return visit meant more money for me, but all diagnosis were validated over the phone with dispatch, and dispatch would also talk to the customer and ask them some questions too to make sure everything is done right.  It was fun and easy, and educational.  But I was on my own out there.  The customer’s computer was broken. I didn’t have internet access - smartphones didn’t exist.   Laptops were super expensive, and dialing over a cellular modem was stupid slow and also ridiculously expensive.  Nobody did that.  


So, one of my most critical tools (beside my memory and sheer tenacity) involved a blue tri-fold CD case that I bought at Walmart.  Oddly enough, 20 years later, I can still remember picking among the available cases for something that had enough slots but wasn’t too big to fit in my rolling tool/laptop bag and wasn’t too expensive.  CDs were a big deal then.  Cassettes were still on sale, but barely.  They were starting to phase them out entirely.  The iPod was not yet a thing.  CDs were a very big deal.  So, cases were popular and not many were made in China yet, so they were not cheap. 


Anyway, the computer technician’s CD collection was something you had to build yourself.  There wasn’t a standard.  You had to figure out what you needed by yourself.


I collected CDs like found treasures.  I had everything.  DOS, NT, Windows 95/98/ME/2k/XP/Vista and Win7. Windows 8 was never in my case. I never used the DOS CD, it was just something someone had and I got a copy of it because “who knows” if I might need it.  Anyway, for those wondering - DOS only came on floppies - someone converted the install to work off CD.  I’m not sure how, I never looked.  But you bet your ass that went into my case.


I had Windows XP OEM vs Retail.  I had Home vs Pro.  I had the Dell OEM version.   VLM / Enterprise versions.  Server versions. The various XP and Windows versions were CRITICALLY important to have because those of us who figured out how to do a “repair install” properly way back in the day pretty much figured it out on our own. The trick was to have the right VERSION of the CD or your product key wouldn’t work with it.   With the right technique I could even move your windows install to new hardware without a bluesreen.  Believe it or not someone being able to move your windows install to new hardware was kinda unusual at the time.  The worst thing you can do is repair Windows with the wrong CD and then not be able to activate it with their product key, LOL.  Definitely hard to explain to a customer how suddenly their windows isn’t “genuine” anymore.


Previous versions of Windows had much less strict key code checking.  In fact, I used to have a universal code memorized for 95/98.  I have no idea now what it was now.  But this was something that served
me well on many occasions.  I can’t count how many times I’d ask a customer for their original CD cases or manuals (that’s where the code was stuck depending on the product) and they didn’t have it anymore.  Oops.  Time to stick in the bootleg code from the list that I also kept in my CD case, lol.  

People didn’t have high speed internet, even in the mid- (even late-) 2000s you couldn’t count on customers having it.  Some folks just didn’t have it yet.  So, you needed to be self sufficient.

Most of my CDs were copies.  I made a copy of anything I could.  Of course I had Office - all versions.  Thinks like SpinRite, gParted, Paragon Partition Manager, Acronis w/Universal Restore, Ghost...  AV scanners, hijackthis, autoruns.   Custom BartPE.  Other random “all in one” boot CDs.

I also had to have some blank CDs or DVDs for backups or in case I needed to create a boot CD for something.  There’s been at least a few times where I had to leave a place and come back later with a blank CD because I didn’t have a spare on me.  I also kept a blank floppy and a DOS boot floppy (good for BIOS updates) within my CD case.

Anyway, with flash drives being ubiquitous and internet being ubiquitous (my cell can tether at high speed, etc) I started noticing I’m using flash drives more and CDs less. Laptops are not coming with CD drives.  Servers are not coming with CD drives.  Software doesn’t come in a box.

I haven’t used a CD *at all* in at least 5 years.  

I opened my CD case today.  Everything I have touched in many years has been Windows 10.  I won’t need a CD for that.  I don’t have a CD for that.  I thumbed through it all... there’s nothing in it there that I need anymore.  I pulled them all out one by one, considering each one.  For a few of them I would reflexively think for a moment “oh yeah I need that one, it’s a keeper”.  Moments later I would remind myself that “no, I will never need it again.”  


I did save a couple truly unique ones to make an .iso image “just in case I decide to play around with them someday” and then I threw all of the CDs away.  

Though, I’m not sure I’m ready to throw my case away.  It’s weird to realize that I have some odd attachment to this ragged blue peice of junk.  It’s empty.  It has no CDs. I don’t need it anymore.  But it’s still in my drawer.

I do have a collection of software and software tools, but it’s on my hard drive (and also backed up).  These days I just I copy things onto a flash if I need them, or just use them over the network.  I definitely don’t have the same emotional attachment to my current collection of stuff that I seem to have had with my CDs. I know if I lose something these days I can just google it and download it again wherever I am.

Like many of you, I am taking over an environment I didn't configure, so I am trying to figure out why we are seeing errors.

First, there is some broken delegation when I run 'dcdiag /test:dns' and it looks like this:

TEST: Delegations (Del)

Error: DNS server: dc1.mydomain.local IP: (Insert DC1 IP here)

\[Broken delegated domain mydomain.local.mydomain.local. \]

Error: DNS server: dc2.mydomain.local IP: (Insert DC2 IP here)

\[Broken delegated domain mydomain.local.mydomain.local. \]

Error: DNS server: dc3.mydomain.local IP: (Insert DC3 IP here)

\[Broken delegated domain mydomain.local.mydomain.local. \]

Error: DNS server: dc1.mydomain.local IP: (Insert DC1 IP here)

\[Broken delegated domain prd.mydomain.local. \]

Error: DNS server: dc2.mydomain.local IP: (Insert DC2 IP here)

\[Broken delegated domain prd.mydomain.local. \]

Error: DNS server: dc3.mydomain.local IP: (Insert DC3 IP here)

\[Broken delegated domain prd.mydomain.local. \]

(I don't know what this prd.mydomain.local record is for)

Second - in our DNS mgmt on our Windows DCs, there are a few things I don't understand. I do see that 'prd' sub folder under our mydomain.local zone, and it has nameserver records for all three of our DCs. Also, we have the 'Forward Lookup zones' with a '\_msdcs.mydomain.local' in it's own zone, which has nameserver records for all three DCs and CNAMEs for all three DCs. It also has the dc, domain, etc sub folders in it. Then we have our mydomain.local zone with a sub folder for '\_msdcs' which just has nameserver records for all three of our DCs.

Sorry if this is a lot of info all in one here, but I am at a loss at how we can fix this. I also found other posts about broken delegation, but a lot of solutions have been finding some duplicate or erroneous record that they deleted and it fixed the issue. I am not seeing such records in our environment though.

I appreciate any advice and feedback as always!

\*\*EDIT: We removed the prd folder since we determined it wasn't needed, and now the delegation error for that went away. We also found a .local folder with a duplicate record that we'll be deleting as well, which will hopefully solve the other broken delegation.

I am working on the SX-200 in one of my client's places with around 100+ analog handsets, they keep complaining about that the handset is down. most of the time they might had pulled the analog line wires.

So is there a way to find out in the SX-200 system that the analog handset is connected/Not connected to the ONS port. ? Like any kind of indication in the control system.

From what I have noticed until now the basic status report shows only ""Idle""  i.e the line is proper and working. But it's not confirming whether the handset is connected/Not connected to the ONS port.

Any suggestions are help full. It would be really great if there is a feature like that.

Environment:

\- Exchange 2013 On Prem

\- Skype For Business Online

\-Azure AD connector for connecting AD on prem with Azure AD.

\-Office 365 (Skype for business only)

&amp;#x200B;

We have one user, whose original mailbox account was used for years. This account we decommisioned (currently disabled). 

The request was to move the on-prem mailbox to another on-prem AD User account owned by this person.

Steps completed:

* Created new AD User account (not in exchange)
* Disabled existing user A's mailbox
* Connected Disabled Mailbox User A's to New AD-User B.
* Deleted User A from Azure AD.
* Ran Full Azure AD Syncronization to populate User A in Azure AD.

Now the issue we have is LegacyExchangeDN is cutoff during the move (powershell was used and -expandproperty was not). The copy/paste cut off part of the X500 address and now how can I recreate it?

Im looking to use 2 routers to setup a squid proxy. 

one router will NAT in to the squid server, then the squid server will proxy out via the 2nd router. 

I have setup the squid with the default gateway to the 2nd router, NAT'd in the port from the 1st to the squid. it does not work, assuming this is due to the default gateway of the Squid server.

from the LAN it works fine. I have opened up the ACL for all inbound connections.

949,t3_gfe1b8,"Good day everyone,

I am wanting to gain a better understanding of how ATA plays a role in some of its functions.  Presently on the network we've had ATA alerting the SysAdmins that generic LDAP has been used and to switch to secure LDAP.  What I'm starting to notice is that the devices are falling off of the list after people are changing to port 636 and selecting SSL despite actually obtaining a certificate to go along with it.  

Am I incorrect in thinking that this is literally sending clear-text data over a port that is used for secure encrypted data?  Next time I'm in the office I will have the opportunity to run Wireshark and see if this is indeed the case but I wanted to have an open discussion about this.  I'm assuming that ATA is just checking what port is in use and reporting accordingly and doesn't do any sort of deep dive into the security piece of whether the data is actually secure/encrypted or not. ",Microsoft ATA and discovering unsecure LDAP connections,r/sysadmin,0.5,0,2,{},1
950,t3_gfdtjy,"So I'm looking for opinions from folks who are fairly familiar with their choices.

In the interest of job security, we're gonna say this is a ""hypothetical situation"". :D

So let's say that I have an elderly AD and LDAP setup.  Neither speak to each other, so each directory is separate.  Users currently exist in both directories with the same usernames, but no passwords are sync'd.  And of course all the management of these systems is done via arcane tools and scripts that were copied off of scrolls that traversed the Atlantic on the May Flower.

So now I'm (again, hypothetically) looking for a modern directory system.  User accounts for Windows and Linux workstations, so therefore I need AD and LDAP equivalent functionality.  Integrating with Office 365 may be nice, but not 100% necessary.  There are other SaaS services that would use AD or LDAP integration for authentication.  And the current AD domain is irrelevant, so an entirely new domain can be created.

So for options, there is the obvious of on-prem AD.  I've setup AD before to auth Win and Linux users.  I could do old school LDAP on-prem, and a Samba 4 setup for the Windows users.  There are even ""wrapper"" options like Univention that put a GUI on basic LDAP and Samba.  Heck Webmin could probably do the same.

There are cloud offerings like Azure AD (which I think still requires on-prem DC's).  JumpCloud is another one I have started to look at, and am curious about that one.  Okta I think is more for SSO than a directory server.

I'm trying to use PRTG to run a batch file on the core server when ping to a device drops. I tested in lab by making a batch file that just writes the hostname into a log file and that works perfectly. I can simulate downtime in PRTG and the batchfile runs.

952,t3_gfdc0z,"Hi all. I hope this is the appropriate place for this question. I work for a small (&lt;10 person) software company and we run an OpenVPN server through Synology DSM's VPN Server module. It's great, because it requires almost zero configuration, authenticates with a username and password by default (which is our preferred authentication protocol over individual client certificates), and supports up to 30 simultaneous connections (plenty for us). 

However, for our macOS users, we are experiencing some exceptionally weird behavior that has been going on and we've been sucking it up for the past few weeks (a headache for our team members who need to access our local Bitbucket server). I have been unable to find any reports of similar behavior online, nor has OpenVPN's authentication troubleshooting proved useful. We have tried OpenVPN Connect Client and Tunnelblick, and use the default .ovpn configuration that is provided by the Synology interface.

Users will attempt to connect to the VPN, receive the error ""Missing external certificate"" which you can continue past anyway, and then often times will have to retry the login 10-15 times getting ""User authentication failed"" errors in the client, until eventually a successful connection is established. We've whitelisted the affected user's IP addresses from the Synology ""Auto Block"" feature which evidently prevents login from an IP after a certain number of failed logins, which did not improve the situation. Interestingly, the VPN Server module's log viewer only shows connect/disconnect events, and not any failed authentication messages. We get similar behavior using Tunnelblick - here's some relevant log information:

We would all greatly appreciate any assistance. We also have a Windows Server 2012 R2 installation that we could run the VPN server on, however the configuration seems much more complex for it.

This works out to being onsite at one district most of the time, and the other I go to three days every two weeks.

No matter the amount of research I have done on this subject, I am always left with more questions than answers. Thanks Microsoft!

We're attempting to get quotes on what it would take in order to sufficiently license our environment with Windows Server 2019 standard. Hopefully someone can break down the math for me.

We are looking to have 8 operating systems in use in our environment. We have two hosts. Each host has 2 sockets, and each socket has 10 cores. This means between the two hosts, we would be licensing 20 cores. This is where the information for me has been becoming tricky:

Since this is a virtual environment where the VMs could migrate to the other host, should I be looking to purchase enough licenses for 16 OSEs? And does each ""full license"" contain 2 OSEs? If yes, then my math seems to be as follows:

Cores (20) \* 8 (since each license covers 2 OSEs) = 160 cores to be licensed

Cores / 2 = 80 2-license packs

80 \* \~$121 = $9680 to have this environment fully licensed.

We also removed her Google account from her Android phone and installed Outlook app (with MS account) and enabled contacts sync. No issues there.

**The issue is with mobile phone numbers.** 

Quite a few contacts on O365, do not appear to have the phone numbers. **I realize this is because the user was using custom labels on her contacts (on gmail) and these labels do not exist on Outlook. So, i'm assuming those phone numbers got ignored in the migration process.**

Both ends are having pretty frequent connection issues. It's ZFS to ZFS but we're only taking a subset of the data so we can't just copy a snapshot.

rsync over a jump server is fine; I can use keys to get onto the destination and was thinking of using sshpass to get through the gateway (not ideal, but none of these requirements are, so...). The password needs to be in a file somewhere (cron has to source the environment, or sshpass can read from the file), unless I want to babysit it every evening and morning. I'm going to use a python script to orchestrate the rsync job, restart after connection issues, and send a SIGTERM when our time is up. I'm pretty sure CPU isn't a limiting factor but I'm going to disable compression and use a weak SSH cipher just in case - as I say, most of the files are compressed already. tar over netcat isn't useful because it won't easily resume after an exit. Running rsync from the destination to avoid the jump server isn't possible due to the origin's VPN.

999,t3_gf7304,"**In short:** Can we remove old  (Enterprise CA) Certification Authority server from domain, and install new one with different settings, without braking our Microsoft Active Directory domain?

**Explanation:** Situation is like this: someone, some time in past installed Certification Authority in Active Directory. CA was installed on Domain Controller, and because this is bad practice, we backed up CA and moved it (restore it) to new server. Now, we need upgrade (change some core settings) this CA because we are planing to use it as imagined and we figured out that CA is install as ""yes -&gt; yes-&gt; yes-&gt; next -&gt; i agree...""  simply said, with everything default, and that is not what we want, so we need to decommission it. It is the root CA and only CA that we have.

So the question is, can we decommission it, will that break whole AD, can we remove it completely and install new CA (Enterprise CA) in our domain plus subordinate CA.

Hoping someone's seen this before or can explain why it might be happening.

We have a number of enterprise apps deployed utilizing Azure AD for identity management.

We have conditional access in place.. normal behavior is that MFA is only required when logging in from a location beyond our country's borders.

We have enabled SSPR (self service password reset) which works fine since it was implemented mid 2019.

In early Feb this year, we enabled the MFA + SSPR converged registration portal. All was well.

In early March, an odd issue started happening. For only 2 of our enterprise apps, every time a user logs in, they get the message saying they are required to complete their security registration, and it directs them to the MFA + SSPR portal to complete it. Virtually all users are already registered, and when they get there it just says setup complete, then they're able to login to the app.

It doesn't matter whether they've already completed their security info or not. They get directed there every time they log in. I've confirmed this with several users who definitely had their security info registered.

This is wierd and it should just be logging straight into the app. They are all in-country when this happens and i've confirmed via AAD logs they are not being flagged by conditional access.

There's no other logs i can find in AAD that explains this behaviour, and its only affected 2 particular applications.

Good job on the new Office update.

At the same time as this, your 365 email servers are shitting themselves and causing Outlook to ask for people's creds ad nauseum.

1031,t3_geojg0,"Gave my two week notice yesterday to a company that I spent the past 11 years at and I actually really enjoyed working for. Don’t get me wrong... it had its share of BS, just like any job will have. But the small, 3 person, IT team meshed well together and wasn’t where any work dramas would happen. Which I appreciated greatly. 

I was able to learn a lot there, on a lot of different technologies, with a lot of different vendors. I had to wear the “jack-of-all-trades” hat, which came with its’ own pros &amp;amp; cons. Networking, VoIP, Monitoring/SIEM, Windows, VMware Virtualization, Backups, Cloud platforms... I got to touch and manage it all. It really expand my depth and scope of knowledge in a way that would be hard to replicate.

In the end my new job is giving me a 4 day work week (something I’ve always desired), a sizable jump in pay (just in time for a coming baby), and more opportunities for greater future growth and movement.

The two key takeaways that I would like to share are: 

(1) Get some certifications. I know a lot of people have heavy feelings on both sides of the “are certs worth it” debate. For years I was always ‘meh’ about earning certs. There is a place for knowledge and experience over a  cert. But in the last couple years I’ve started actively pursuing certs and you’d be surprised at the number of potential doors it has opened. I’ve gotten quite a few offers from places, just for having that “silly” piece of paper. I’m talking about learning and knowing a subject matter enough to pass a certification on it. With all the online learning resources out there, it should not be too hard to find some study materials or on-demand labs to help you. 

I feel like you should engage that big heap of gray matter you have and earn a certification. That cert is a tangible asset from a 3rd party which verifies that you know the particular subject matter of what the cert is for. Hell, aim low, if you want! Find an “easy” (that term is relative to your current knowledge level and skill sets) and minimal effort certification you can work on in your down, or off, time. That spark of satisfaction you get after you earn one certification will likely carry you to earning your next one.

(2) Be yourself and make friends. It really is your circle of connections and people you interact with that can pull you forward. I feel like this new job sprouted from a conversation I had a couple years back with the husband of a friend of my wife’s. We got along well (both worked in IT, different roles and industries). When they had a position open, he reached out about the opening. It was a great opportunity. I applied and ultimately got the job. 

Thanks for reading my wall of text...

I want to migrate all leases,reservations,scope options from old dhcp server to new dhcp server with minumum downtime.

Now , We have total 50 scope per VLAN. Also , We have been using 802.1.x authentication.

My environment is :

Old server : 

    dhcp2k12r2-01 (10.0.0.1) and dhcp2k12r2-02 (10.0.0.2) (DHCP HA - Hot Standby Mode)

New server :

    dhcp2k19-01 (10.0.0.3) and dhcp2k19-02 (10.0.0.4) (DHCP HA - Hot Standby Mode)

My migrate plan is : Am I right ? Is there any missing step ? or What do you recommended anything else ?

\- Install DHCP Server role both server

\- Remove failover relationship on [10.0.0.1](https://10.0.0.1)

\- Disabled / stopped dhcp server service on [10.0.0.2](https://10.0.0.2) and remove dhcp role then shutting down server

\- Assign dhcp2k19-02 ([10.0.0.4](https://10.0.0.4))  -&gt; 10.0.0.2  same as old server

\-  Export dhcp server setings on dhcp2k12r2-01

\-  Import dhcp (serverconfigonly) dhcp2k19-01 and dhcp2k19-02

\- Authorize dhcp2k19-01

\-  Create failover relationship between dhcp2k12r2-01 and dhcp2k19-01 (10.0.0.3) ( **Reuse existing failover relationships** )

\-  After replication ,  remove failover on dhcp2k19-01 ([10.0.0.3](https://10.0.0.3)).

\- - Disabled / stopped dhcp server service on [10.0.0.](https://10.0.0.2)1  and remove dhcp role then shutting down server

\- Assign dhcp2k19-01 ([10.0.0.](https://10.0.0.4)3)  -&gt; 10.0.0.1  same as old server

\-  lastly  , create failover dhcp2k19-01 (10.0.0.3) and dhcp2k19-02

I recently joined a company where the admin setup DFS and pooched it by ""helping DFS"" by manually copying over files to speed up the process.

A little background:  Joined the IT world about a year ago and I'm working as a Jr. Sys Admin in a manufacturing setting (4 main plants).  Solid proficiency in the tech, A+ certified, and always looking to learn new skills, tech, etc. 

Now, I had an issue today where a ticket came in about a computer that wasn't working properly, but it didn't come from that computers owner, it came from another user in the factory (receptionist).  Issue was stated in ticket as ""they can't access the pc, keeps kicking them off, can't access email... blah blah.""  Well as this particular PC has only one user and the plant manager forbade anyone from using it besides the person who's job it is to sit at that desk, I responded with ""who is ""they""?  As I understood, this computer is only supposed to have one user and nobody else is supposed to be touching that pc"".  

This was not read in the manner it was written and managed to piss off the receptionist.  She complains to her boss (the plant manager) and my boss gets an chewing out from the plant manager that he wants nothing to do with me and he doesn't want me anywhere near his plant.  Then a bunch more comes out from other workers there, plant floor and supervisors alike, that I'm rude to them and not professional.  All tickets from this plant are to now go through the Sys admin instead of me trying to troubleshoot.

This incident has made me ill.  A full plant not allowing me at their site because the tiny amount of interaction I have with their user base has ruffled some feathers.  I consider myself efficient, the work is normally done early when I make these trips.  I've never heard a single complaint until today when it all avalanched on my bosses desk.  

What do I do?

Looking for some input from MSP / Breakfix dudes.

I work for a small IT company that offers MSP and Breakfix services.  We have around 100 clients and at the moment our main source for documentation is ConnectWise Manage.

1069,t3_gerv6c,"(TL;DR at the bottom) So as I'm sure many of you have noticed, phishers are increasingly using compromised SharePoint and Sway sites to phish people. These scams usually consist of a SP or Sway site that has an additional URL inside of it that says something like ""Click here to view document"". That link will then take its victim to a phishing site or worse, download malware. The company I work for starting getting many of these phishing emails and our spam filter, Mimecast, was not detecting any of the links as malicious. As a temporary fix to prevent our users from threatening the security of the whole company, I put a wildcard external SharePoint and Sway site block into place in Mimecast. The issue is, Mimecast does not allow you to whitelist individual URLs when you have used a wildcard block. As im sure you can imagine, this causes a considerable amount of false positives. I've reached out to Mimecast support and they could not think of a better solution. Does anyone here have any ideas for a better way to handle this situation? 

TL;DR - I had to block literally all external SharePoint and Sway links sent to us via email to stop a common phishing scam that many people fall for because our spam filter doesn't detect it otherwise.

1076,t3_gese6b,"I help run a small not for profit club (a membership based makerspace) and I am seeking input on system administration technologies to help us with a more streamlined operation. I have a background in ""computers,"" but system administration is outside of my wheelhouse. I was hoping to be pointed in the direction of some reading material as well as any general advice.

The overall goal is to manage memberships and member access to assets. In few bullet points:

* Collection of member dues is tied to member's continued access to the club and its assets. If payment is overdue, access is automatically suspended.
* Members can access a self-help portal to view their contact info, update payment info, etc
* Members are granted access to assets either by administrative users or peers qualified to grant access. Assets include tools (power controlled by microcontroller), websites and computers

We are a ""pull yourselves by the bootstraps"" sort of club, and so far here is what's in place:

* Using Stripe for payment processing via Stripe's dashboard. Member payment info is initiated via a  Stripe Checkout page and then updates are managed by the Treasurer, by hand.
* FreeIPA on AWS for ""access control."" On the software side it means access to the Mediawiki (also on AWS) via PluggableAuth. We don't have much documentation on the FreeIPA set up and it could probably use a fresh start.
* Physical access control at the club's entrance using a RaspberryPi hooked up to an electric door strike and RFID fob reader. The RPI runs an instance of FreeIPA that is synchronized with the AWS copy. When a fob is scanned, FreeIPA is searched for an active user with same door code and access is granted/denied.
* Members are added/removed to AWS FreeIPA and mailing list via a shell script
* Access to everything else in the club is on the honor system. There are a few Windows machines that we would love to switch to individual log-ins, instead of a shared one
* Most of the infrastructure lives in AWS and we have plenty of AWS credits annually that we would like to use more.
* We have a few Windows server licenses that have not yet been used
* There is a physical server rack in the space, but it's mostly doing nothing other than provide access to the WAN. Could be invested into.

In my limited understanding, it seems that we should set up either Windows AD (locally) or LDAP properly (locally or in AWS) and use that as the database for member info, somehow tying in the local Windows workstations. From there on we can probably write scripts or code to tie the system to Stripe and access control microcontrollers.

[Solarwinds Cattools](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-cattools) works great for the routers, and firewalls; however, some of the switches just don't work with Cattools. So after hunting the Internet for a bit, I found a solution using a Visual Basic script.

What I did was create a 'switches.txt' file with the IP addresses of the switch(es) I was backing up. Keep in mind, though, that all of the IP(s) in this switches.txt file have to have the same username and password; if they don't, you can create another folders with other switches.txt file and another script, and execute it from that folder.

I tried using '[putty](https://putty.org/)' but I couldn't get putty to accept the passwords using ssh via the vbs script, so I ended up using [kitty.exe](https://download.cnet.com/KiTTY/3000-2155_4-10698301.html). Your mileage may vary.

I put kitty.exe in the C:\\Download\\ folder. If you put it somewhere else, change the script accordingly.

After creating the script(s) I run them in a task scheduler (I use [system scheduler](https://www.splinterware.com/products/scheduler.html)). 

Copy the text below and save it with the .vbs extension, and edit it; point it at the switches you want to backup.

Your mileage WILL vary. You will have to do a little work to get this to work, but the pay off is that you can automate the switch backups

All of the group policies I have created run very quickly all of them add less than 3 seconds to processing time combined. The unchanged default domain policy however, I have seen take over 11 seconds to process, is this a normal processing time for the default policy?

I’m also curious to hear how others would setup an org like this. How would you do your network, and server infrastructure?

In our ""Company.local"" zone, we have quite a few A records  that say (Same as parent folder) with IP addresses that correspond to our DCs. Sounds normal. But what worries me is about half of them have timestamps that are a few weeks or even a few months old and would get removed by scavenging. They still represent DCs that are online and ""should"" be updating these timestamps hourly (Or so I've read). Also it seems that for the affected DCs, it's only these A records that aren't getting updated timestamps. All other SRV records from the same DCs look fine.

Not so much looking to see what files/folders are taking up space but rather who/where data is getting dropped on to a file server.

My suspicious is that different groups are moving data around (sometimes duplicating it), working through a process, and then either moving the sanitzed data again elsewhere. Management is seeing the data use and has tasked me to try and determine what may be happening.

UEV sounds great, as my ""users"" are my kids in the scenario, and they have O365 through their school district. All of their schoolwork is saved on Teams/OneDrive/Sharepoint. 

But for things that are local, I can use one of the solutions above. UEV seems to be dead or dying? Looks like it's been in v2.1 for a while, with little to no update on documentation. Wondering if Microsoft abandoned this for the whole ""sign in with Microsoft to sync""

I also saw some where about setting up WorkFolders and folder redirecting to those. But would you redirect something like APPDATA to that?

The interview went smoothly and I handled everything they threw at me pretty well, but now that I'm actually here I feel like a deer caught in headlights.

I'm now the infosec admin for a mid-sized company that's only just started to put together an IT team over the past 5 years. They really don't have any security policies or controls in place yet, and it seems like that's going to be my responsibility going forward. I think that I can handle it, after all it's what I got myself into student loan debt for, but having this much responsibility is getting to my head.

I am very interested in ethical hacking and coding. 

There is a lot of information out there on careers; however, education has now become more of a racket predicated on squeezing a few bucks out of people who don't know better.

&amp;#x200B;

I wondered if anyone had any ideas for me; I have a server which is refusing to backup due to the state of the C:\\ drive. (Our backup software does various checks before it starts)

There's definitely something wrong with the C: Drive:

* Every time the server boots it attempts a CHKDSK, which never seems to resolve
* Using Contig.exe I found the C:\\ disk very fragmented
* FSutil states the disk is in a dirty state
* Defrag isn't possible, I guess because it has this dirty state set and I guess you don't want to defrag a dirty disk anyway? Might just cause more issues?
   * Just for clarification the C:\\ doesn't appear in the drag GUI and command line doesn't allow it either

* I've tried running an offline chkdsk  (chkdsk /f /r) and a sfc /scannow

Everyone's jobs are being transferred to the new company, but a lot of us (possibly the majority) are not getting a proper job offer, just a 12 month contract. We have all been told that the intention is to hire us after this, but several of the people in the same group as me did get instant full offers.

What bothers me is that the people who did get the full offer work largely with our on-site stuff, while those of us who got contracts are remote employees who work more with AWS, me included. (The new company has a fair number of remote employees so I'm not worrying specifically about the intention being to get rid of all of our remote people, but more if it's targeted towards AWS people.) Our AWS infrastructure is on the complicated side and I'm the longest-standing employee who works primarily with it and probably have the best idea of how stuff fits together.

If the contract actually paid contractor money, I might be fine with it as I could actually save some up to cover a gap at the end, but right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck, and I'm getting paid basically the same with just a small increase which really isn't more than the inflation increase I would have otherwise got if my job had stayed the same (proper increases and bonuses were suspended due to the pandemic). In general I'm underpaid, while I like the culture and the people and it's too early to tell what the new company is like and how that might change, so I'm putting that aside for now.

I'm a bit wary of some changes that are clearly coming down the pipeline (e.g. they're Micro$oft Everything while we're largely open source based and free to use tools that don't suck), but what really bothers me is the 12 month contract. I work remotely largely because I'm stuck in a city that has almost no tech industry short of a few development sweatshops (local people who don't know shit about the tech industry love to claim there is one here, but there really isn't), and I don't want to end up screwed over a year from now having to compete with the whole country for remote jobs at short notice, as the only local jobs I can do are either monkey work for a third of the pay, or suit-wearing megacorps who would reject me as soon as I walked into the room. I'm a medium company person, who needs the kind of place where I can look how I want and have autonomy to use the right tools for the job, while still getting paid money I can actually live on.

Does anyone else have experience with being moved to a contract? Is this a red flag or something more common than I thought, and if so, why give full offers to some people and not others?

Hoping everyone is safe and sound during the lockdown!

Linux newbie here (apologies for any incorrect terms or lack of verbose diagnostics), wondering if anyone out there can provide me a helping hand or steer me in the right direction.

**Background** \- We have a couple of Windows Server 2012 R2 file server running DFS (n and r), with multiple DFS shares. Our Linux estate mounts these shares using SMB with multi-user mode via NTLMSSPI. The idea being, the mount config is in fstab with creds of an account that simply just does the mounting. Whilst pam\_cifscreds passes the end-user credentials to the kernel keyring automatically at login. All this config is deployed and managed via puppet5.

OS = Ubuntu 18.04uname - a = 4.15.0-96-lowlatency #97-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Wed Apr 1 04:10:58 UTC 2020 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

Fstab:

    //fileshare/Share      /net/f  cifs    vers=3.02,multiuser,_netdev,sec=ntlmsspi,file_mode=0750,dir_mode=0755,credentials=/etc/samba/credentials    0       2

**Problem a)** User has created a service that simply does a kinit for a service account and then runs a ls on a mounted SMB shared /net/f to test mount reliability. It runs every hour to continuously poll the mount. (Now there could just be something wrong with this test itself but bear with me). It works for a short while but fails thereafter with:

    &lt;hostname&gt; run_test.sh[75853]: ls: cannot access '/net/f/Apps': Permission denied  

If I su as the service account running that script, and do a ls myself. /net/f, is there. Once I re-run the service after my su/ls, it resolves for a few hours. Then it fails again with the same error.

It's lead me to believe that it's the kernel keyring that's not right here?

The kern.log shows this log:

    [106415.123493] audit: type=1400 audit(1588686578.583:1933): apparmor=""ALLOWED"" operation=""open"" profile=""/usr/sbin/sssd"" name=""/run/systemd/users/835005388"" pid=64837 comm=""krb5_child"" requested_mask=""r"" denied_mask=""r"" fsuid=0 ouid=0

**Problem b)**  (Different host but running the same mount config via fstab and SMB) Related to drive mounts again. We have another service account which isn't able to ls the same /net/f as above, but can get to the other mounts whilst we su. When we try to ls on /net/f, we get:

    ls: reading directory '.': Permission denied

I've tried to update the cifscreds details manually, a reboot, umount/mount. Still no luck. I think both issues are linked.

We've been using SMB 3.02 + NTLMSPPI previously but it was without the multi-user mode. The break glass solution for me is to revert the multi-user mode back to just using the mount creds as the access creds. I don't believe this is the right way to resolve it as it leaves a security hole.

My plead for help is two fold, how do others implement this? Secondly, what are we doing wrong? This was put in by our previous Linux Admin (not claiming to be one, just check my username).

Should I look into autofs and steer away from fstab? Or should I move from NTLMSPPI to Kerberos (previous admin said he couldn't find a solution for when Kerberos tickets expired as the kernel wasn't able to regenerate them, which led to shares timing out).

I appreciate any help, thanks for looking at my post :)

This is going to be long, I apologize but right now I feel I have to talk about it to get past this stomach sick feeling. I'm stressed to my max right now, even thought of arguments about how this situation happened and how I'm only partly responsible.

I spent the last 3 months planning a reconfiguration of my NAS where my backups are stored. I had drive failures that was popping up at a freakishly high rate, 5 drives failed within 3 months. All drives were less than a year old.

I started prep to move my annual backups to make room for at least 3 weeks of backups so I can do my move with as little stress as possible.

I have 5 weeks worth of backups off site so I was covered for those, but I had no where to put my annual backups. I made room on our old retired nas systems and was able to move everything but this year's annual backup. I had to break those down in half and move half of the set of backup files onto one server and the other half onto another server. Needless to say I barely had room on 4 different devices for my backups, but I managed.

I was hoping to spend a week looking at the NAS and figuring out how to rebuild the raid the wy I wanted because 5/12 drives failed literally within 3 months, haven't figured out yet if it was bad drives or if something else killed the drives with the config. I was not expecting that, I had 4 drives set aside for failure and up until 2 weeks ago I still had 1 spare drive to keep me alive before all spares were used. We had no stand by drives because we couldn't afford it.

Well I couldn't wait any longer the day I decided to rebuild the nas for backups, the final drive gave out. Not too worried about it because I had already moved everything over to good locations.

Today I spent hours rebuilding the NAS and locating all of the old backups to move over but I couldn't find half of our annual backups. I panicked so bad, I'm feeling so sick to my stomach right now.

I made an emergency run to the office because I needed to know if I messed up or just being paranoid. Plugged one of the old nas in by USB, I wasn't expecting that it could hold the data that I was looking for but, there it was. All of the backups that I needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am heart racing, sweat pouring out of me, sick to my stomach from stress. I had a good idea that I'm not that reckless, I definitely wouldn't do something like that without making sure I had everything in order first. But in the moment, logic is out the window and panic sets in.

Thank god I spent 3 months working on this and triple checking my work as I went along. I truly think I would have ruined my reputation if I messed this up and most likely out of a job. The lesson I learned, always create a temporary document listing what work you did setting anything up. No matter how big or small the project is, document your work.

Documentation doesn't have to be about policy or procedures, sometimes having a progress log on your work even if you plan on deleting once the work is done can save your mental. I did not mess up today and its going to take me a while to come down off this stress.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Spent 3 months planning a project that would prevent a crisis with backups. Shortly after my prep was finished I hit breaking point and had to enact my plan before I had a chance to inventory where I had stored the backups. Rebuilding the backup system today and moving backups back to it, got a scare that I deleted 4 sets of year-end backups. Max panic set in and I went to my office to plug in our old backup system because I knew some files were moved there but I didn't expect all of them. Turns out all of the files I needed were on the old system that wasn't plugged in and if I had taken inventory of those backups then I wouldn't have panicked.

&amp;#x200B;

Also before anyone criticizes me about documentation, I had documentation on everything else for this project. I had documented how I was rebuilding the raid, total storage, number of spare drives, model numbers for each drive, even the names of folders for the file system where the backups would be kept. Everything but where the backups were stored temporarily, I didn't get a chance to do that before I had to dive into the rebuild.

I need a very simple tool that can alert me via e-mail when a server goes offline (aka unpingable) or the VPN tunnel goes down, or if there is a large amount of packet loss to a specific IP. That is the only features I really need. Just basic network monitoring.

1173,t3_geec6i,"Hey there,

First things first the details of the server,etc:

Windows Server 2003 (Basically used as a network drive only)   
Watchguard xtm 5 series (unsure of model, was configured by previous ISP to allow for simultaneous internet connections, it's no longer needed but for some reason have constant issues with internet when trying to remove it.)  
Vodafone NBN Modem  
few netgear network switches  
2 hot spots  


How the server is connected:  


Server PC plugs into wall socket, it's sent to another socket which then goes into the watchguard,

In the watchguard you have 3 cables (first cable is the server cable from the socket, second cable is the WAN cable from the NBN modem to the watchguard and the third cable is the uplink for our 2 hotspots connected by a PoE.

Now I would personally like to remove the watchguard altogether as it was initially just meant to load balance 2 adsl connections because we were unable to obtain any other type of internet until recent, however when unplugging the watchguard and simply plugging server into any of the switches with the modem and PoE cable doesn't seem to allow anything to work, plugging it back into the watchguard then somehow makes it all work? (this is not the case now as the TCP/IP details have been reset on the server and it's having communication issues), it was config'd remotely and the ISP won't give me anything in regards to how to to configure it myself or anything similar so it just sits there without any knowledge of how to use it or how to remove it.  


How the issue started:

Today I had some issues with a printers IP address stating that the IP address that it was using was already taken, so I had gone into our windows server 2003 and checked the DHCP and DNS to see if there was any devices taking the address, I could see that no device had taken its IP address or leased it, so I simply reset the printer assuming it would detect that no other device has the IP and simply use it but it still kept stating that the IP was in use.

I then went onto the windows 2003 machine and went to command prompt and did a basic flushdns to see if that would work and it didn't appear to do anything so I then did the following commands:

netsh int ip reset  
netsh winsock reset  
ipconfig /release  
ipconfig /renew  


now after this my server attempted to assign new details to its local area connection, it seemed to have deleted the TCP/IP settings that were set for the server to be on a static IP address and I can't remember the exact IP address the server was set to, I remember the gateway and such.

Now after I had done those commands the printer decided that the IP address was now free but then the wireless and all internet connections were lost.  


So far I have a small workaround, however it isn't what I'd like.

To achieve this workaround I set my IP address of the windows 2003 server to the same as the gateway ([192.168.1.250](https://192.168.1.250)) and I am able to achieve internet on some devices by ethernet (a few are limited and unable to get an ip address) as well as wireless however the server itself is unable to access the internet and wireless devices are unable to access the shared drives or print to the printers, so I change the IP address to [192.168.1.252](https://192.168.1.252) (same as the gateway) to see if that allows for any network drive access, the internet access for the Ethernet and wireless connections remain however access to the shared folders and printers are then not working, also windows 2003 server pc constantly spits out that is has an IP address conflict when changed to 1.252.

If I change the IP address to be anything but 1.250 or 1.252 it doesn't give internet or shared drive access to the ethernet or wireless connections. 

Ideally I just want to be able to access my shared network drives via the wireless internet again, but this has been the biggest headcase today all because a printer wanted to claim its ip address was a duplicate.

Now I am without internet to over 90% of the devices in the business and the network drive is only accessible via one computer that is connected via Ethernet.

Basically, using VEEAM we are taking incremental backups during the week, and full VBK backups on the weekends. These jobs run successfully, and successfully transfer to our Synology NAS for safe storage.

However, in my case it is, and yet it still remains seen as Unconfigured (Good) Unsupported. I'm running an LSI 9260-4i connected to 4 Seagate ST900MM0006 10K.6 SAS drives. And although they are shown to be compatible on the Gen2 compatibility list, ([https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/MegaRAID-SAS-Gen2CompatibilityList](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/MegaRAID-SAS-Gen2CompatibilityList)), the controller refuses to work with the drives, and upon attempting to create a RAID volume, it fails. Even after a firmware update to the latest firmware (circa 2015) it still doesn't work. Now, I thought it could be the fact that on the list of compatible drives, it notes the firmware, and for my drive, it notes firmware A001, however, my drives list firmware 4F08. Could this be it? Surely they can't expect you to have the *exact* same firmware on the list, right? Even if that's so, the date code on my drives says ""15333"" which translates to Feb 16, 2015 when the latest firmware for the controller came out sometime in August of 2015. That seems pretty close in terms of time for them to not support it because it's obsolete. I have put in a ticket with LSI, but they are responding very slowly. Took them about a day for them to respond after putting in the ticket, back with the command to run their logging script, and that was Monday, April 27th. I replied to them with the results on Tuesday, and haven't heard anything since. I also called them, but it went right to voicemail. Maybe they're out for corona? But I did get one response from them so I'm not sure. I've also emailed Seagate to see if maybe the A001 firmware for some reason isn't listed on their site, as after searching for available firmware for my drives, nothing is listed.

We have a couple site-to-site VPNs that we use for our customers. We typically provide a set of specifications regarding algorithms and key sizes, but tunnel addressing as always been something unique and negotiated for each customer.

I know this is decided on a case-by-case basis, but when you set up a VPN with an external business (vendor / customer), do you typically provide:  

* The literal IP / Subnets used on your network (providing there's no overlap between both networks)
* A translated internal IP for the traffic to pass through
* A translated external IP for traffic.

We've tried setting up tunnels using a translated internal IP on both sides of the VPN to prevent addressing conflicts, but we typically run into issues with customers not knowing / unable to set up an address translation. This makes me wonder if it's not commonly used.

SYMPTOMS:
-Machines unable to service logon requests to non-cached profiles.
-Cached profiles' passwords not matching other machines which DO have DC connectivity (usually this is the first symptom).

Okay, it's an issue talking to the DC. Yes and no:

-Can ping domain controller, but cannot resolve through DNS.
-DNS, when it DOES resolve, does so to an external address, which I have tracked down as our marketing firm.
-Some machines work, others do not. It does not appear to be a function of hardware, as far as I can tell.
-Affected machines removed from the domain cannot rejoin (AD DC could not be contacted).
-Affected machines removed from the domain can access the internet and perform normally.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
-Looked at, modified DNS servers, default gateways, etc. Everything seems to be in order. Machines point to DC, DC points to router, router points to outside world (8's)
-DNS Records *look* okay, but this is where my expertise is limited. I've checked the things I've been told to check, and nothing references anything unexpected, but I have no reverse lookup zones (that's never been a problem, before).
-Altered the DCHP scope, which may or may not have anything to do with it. No change to any machine's status.

Troubleshooting I've considered:
-Wipe-and-loading a machine and seeing if the issue persists.
-Blowing away my DNS service and reinstalling it.
-Quietly contemplating the choices I've made with my life.
-Setting the comm closet on fire.

Help me. I'm having a bunch of other issues, but I think they all seem to relate in some way back to this: Printers accessible and inaccessible, depending on the day and their mood, file share requiring and not requiring a password to access (by default it does not, once authenticated), etc.

1216,t3_ge06aw,"Hi

I'm trying to get Always on VPN working properly, I've been following the guide on the MS website and everything has worked as it should until the very end.

When I'm testing the VPN connection on a windows 10 machine it connects straight away using the local certificate on the machine. The issue I'm having it the fact it's not using the NPS server.

I was under the impression you have the certificates installed and it then connects to the VPN server which then checks your AD account is in the correct group before allowing you to connect. I can turn the NPS server off completely and still connect so it doesn't seem to be doing that check

The authentication provider on the VPN server is set to Radius with the correct details in there

We're using AD; and I am pretty sure that means we cannot meet the modern password requirements specified by CJIS. Reading into the latest NIST guideline; hit the same requirement issue. ""Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function""

My understanding is that AD hashes (weakly) the credentials, but they're not actually stored. That means we can't meet these requirements, correct? And I assume anyone else on AD also wouldnt be able to; unless there's another control I'm not thinking of?

Anyways, I don't know much about telephony, and I was tasked with figuring out how we could all call from our personal cell phones but have the phone number pop up as our companies number, or at least a generic shared number. From what I can tell our Mitel 5000 phone system can't do this. Is there any online phone bank type service I could use? Basically we want to call from our personal cell phones to a central number, then dial the customers from that number. 

Best part is, I just found out about this a few minutes ago and they want to start making calls today. So I haven't done much other than precursory googling, most of what I am finding that might do it is focused around political calls, much more complicated than we need it to be, and expensive. Any advice/info would be appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks for the info so far, as I am the only one working on this and then will have to train the end users I may just have to go with the google voice option to hide our real numbers, but with no way for a central number. It appears Callhub.io will do what I want at a cost, but I still am not sure how long that will take to set up. Also there were some suggestions with my Mitel system, there are a few IP phones on it so we pay for those licenses but for the most part they are digital phones hardwired in.

1223,t3_ge0t8u,"**Background:** The Company I work for received new Dell 5400 and 5500s that have intermittent issues connecting to Skype for Business (365) (issue was replicated on multiple versions) on a WiFi connection while working from home connected through our VPN. **Our other laptops from Dell have no issues**. The users that get the issue will either get stuck on the main login screen for Skype on “signing in” or they get passed the sign in screen and just see themselves and everyone else as “**Presence Unknown**” (example [https://filestore.community.support.mic ... b040e2f735](https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0adafef0-7352-4ac7-b004-51b040e2f735))

The laptops have no issues connecting to skype when using a wired Ethernet connection either in the office or at home via VPN. The issue occurs when the user brings their laptop home and connects to their Wi-Fi then to our VPN and tried to sign into skype. This could last up to 90 minutes before finally signing in.

We have already confirmed it is not the VPN causing this issue as our network team ran some tests and confirmed it.We have tried clearing the SIP profile, other user accounts, other Wi-Fi networks, updating the Skype version and nothing worked.

What Temporarily Worked: We thought we had it when we updated the Intel 9560 Wireless Drivers as it worked initially, but a few days to a week later the issue returned. Going into the **Device Manager Advanced Settings** for the Wireless card and changing the **Mimo Power Save Mode** to **Dynamic SMPS** then back to Auto SMPS actually fixes the issue and lets the sign into Skype, but only for a few days as well.

Skype for Business is the only application that is affected by this on our new systems. It seems that the WiFi Card, Skype, and our VPN are not working together and it is becoming harder to pinpoint the issue.

Any suggestions are appreciated and I can provide some more details if needed",Skype for Business Issue with WiFi Drivers and VPN (Presence Unknown/Can't Login),r/sysadmin,0.81,3,1,{},1

You can not override this with the Window 10's power settings. So if you set the laptop to never sleep, or to sleep after a half hour, it will still zonk out at 4 minutes.

Sleeping is baked into the hardware, and there is no way dictate when the laptop sleeps, is what we were told. There is a setting in the BIOS where you can completely block sleep all together. But that does exactly what it says, it removes sleep as an option completely.

Have any of you run into this? It is making remote support a real pain. We usually set our Win10 machines to ""never"" sleep when plugged in. But now they go night-night after 4 minutes no matter what. Which means we have a 4 minute window to jump on a machine remotely and catch it before it goes to sleep. It's hard to impossible in most situations.

**Question 1:** Does that sound right to you? That Energy Star disables Windows 10 power settings and are that strict? 4 minute sleep timer?

**Question 2:** How do remotely support laptops that are asleep? How do you deal with that?",Latitude 7400 and Energy Star - problems with remote support,r/sysadmin,0.81,3,15,{},1

I am currently working on a physical authentication factor (MFA) based on location for cloud hosted services.  


The idea is to authenticate access to certain services using a classical password, and a defined location (e.g. company premises). The location-based authentication factor works by using a physical authenticator whose location is determined by one or more beacons placed in the premises of a company.  


This technology would allow staff to access certain services (can be critical) only from defined, trusted locations  
It could also ease the management of cloud access for short-term collaborators (e.g. visiting partners from another company, consultants…) by granting an access which is only valid in the company’s premises.

I have installed one Exchange 2016 a couple of months ago for journaling only.

This week I have installed two additional Exchange 2016 for a migration from 2010. Everything is working well, however since I have 3 Exchange 2016 in total my migrated mailbox tries to send mails over the dedicated journaling Exchange as well.

So I have server A for journaling and server B and C for actual mail flow ingoing and outgoing. I am not quite sure how to configure server A to only do journaling and not be used as a hop for sending internal messages. Do I just have to disable the receive connectors?

One of the things we have set up is WSUS server. Since we don't have the fastest internet connection, the idea was that we would save bandwidth by having the WSUS server download the updates centrally. However, this was a disaster since we massively underestimated the amount of disk space a WSUS server requires. Also, without careful configuration it downloads a lot more than needed. Finally, we were never using it in the way intended, that is controlling who gets which update when - we just had no time to set up a test group, but instead approved all updates immediately. So we got rid of WSUS for the time being ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .

However, we would still like to be able to have an overview of which computer is requiring updates, and be able to trigger updates remotely if needed. Can you guys recommend a tool for this?

1294,t3_gdetq0,"Hi all,

Little backstory:
I've been working at a ig company for 3 years now. I was hired as an application administrator and made my way to ""Linux System Administrator"" which is my official title now. I'm a self-taught admin, I've loved sys stuff, programming and PC in general since my teenage years. I've written some C# and Python libraries and utilities and I'm an active homelabber.

I was hired when my company decided to form a ops team to help the devs on inner source project to manage all the ops side of thing so basically managing and deploying server, automating deployment and configuration with Chef, monitoring and bringing front line support for users (within the company). 

Fast-forward to now, market is trending a lot toward devops workflow. We are currently working with devs on a development platform project. As other apps, we are in charge of providing the monitoring. Since this app is hosted on Kubernetes, we can't monitor with an agent like we used to, so we are instead discussing how to forward alerts to MS Teams using a webhook. This needs a forwarder to be set to receive alerts and forward them to the needed channel.

I did a POC on a dev cluster of ours and have a working solution I presented today. The solution works for them, but my issue here is that it was pushed by their IT project manager that I (our team) should be the one making the integration to their platform.

I've spoken with one of the devs to have an idea of what were the implications of that. It involves, in my opinion, quite a bit of dev, learning jsonnet (I already know the basics but this is advanced usage) to generate the manifests and fit all these into the makefiles they use to deploy. I think I can reasonnably pull it in about a week, considering all the learning needed and that I can't put 100% of my time on it since some important ticket will come once in a while.

Now, I'm someone who really likes to learn new technologies, languages and such. I taught myself programming, scripting and other techs like Kubernetes, but I think this goes out of my scope. I spoke with my collegues about it(we are a team of 3 guys), they all agree with me but think I might as well do it to prove that what will take me a week would take one of their devs a few hours.

Their(the dev team) point is that to be able to support the platform correctly, I should understand how pieces are interacting with each others.

I find this to be a valid point, but I fail to see where the integration of components fits my job description and my expertise. I've approached my manager about it before and he was agreeing with me but it seems to be a recurring theme, and the line is hard to draw. I don't want to look like the guy who doesn't want to improve, as it's totally not the case but I fear setting a precedent.

First i hope that everyone is doing well!  

I have a small project in my company to migrate all the dropbox team folders to google drive shared drive.  

We are using google suite so there is no need to use and pay for dropbox as a cloud storage where we can use  Google drive for it.  

I have been searching and exploring ways how to make this migration as smooth as possible and with not to much manual work but i can't find away how to export the users and their permissions from a dropbox team folder, i have already asked dropbox support and they don't offer such a feature.  

I can do the data migration easily by syncing the dropbox team folder with Dropbox Desktop app and then from there drag and drop the folder to Shared drive in Google, easily done!  

The hard part is migrating  the users and their corresponding permissions for the Dropbox Team folder,i am talking about folders that have hundred of files inside and doing this manually will take me ages.  

The other problem is that file permissions are different from drive to dropbox, in dropbox you are able to share a subfolder inside the main Team folder  while in drive you are able to share only files inside the main folder and not subfolders .

My company is trying to implement an application for web content filtering, currently we are in the testing phase of deployment. The application is capable of looking at AD security groups and from those applying different filter groups set up in the application console. The way the application gathers information on which group the logged on user is a part of is by scraping the results for the command ""gpresult /r"". Now for the fun part...

Since all our users are working from home right now, they need to connect to a VPN before they are actually connected to the company domain and pull up-to-date group membership for the user account. They can only connect to the VPN after they log into their computer. Because group membership is only pulled to the computer on user login, and the computer must be able to reach out to a domain controller to get updated group membership, the results from ""gpresult /r"" does not include updated group membership. Because the group membership is not updated in those results, the application is not applying any web filter policies to the machine.

So with that, here is what I have tried so far:

From what I could find, group membership is exclusively update on user login, and only if the computer is able to reach out to a domain controller for updated group membership at the time of login. I have confirmed that this is true through logging in on one account, connecting to the VPN, switching users, and logging in to a separate account while on the VPN. When running a gpresult /r under these circumstances, everything works fine.

HOWEVER, there are people that suggest there is a way to get group membership to refresh AFTER logging in. The methods for doing so include using the commands ""gpupdate /force"", ""klist /purge"", and by killing explorer.exe and starting it again running as the user. Unfortunately, every combination and method that I have used with any of these methods does not update the group membership listed in ""gpresult /r""

So with all that said, I have two questions if any of you fine IT professions know.

Where exactly does ""gpresult /r"" gather its data on the group membership of the logged on user? Is it somewhere in the registry, a Kerberos ticket, or somewhere else?

2. in [protection.office.com/antispam](https://protection.office.com/antispam) I've ensured that the server's IP is in the IP allow list of the Connection Filter Policy
3. In [protection.office.com/antispam](https://protection.office.com/antispam) I've ensured that the server is set to 'allow spoofing' within the Spoof Intelligence policy.
4. In DNS/SPF I've ensured that the sending IP address has been added in an 'include' statement.
5. In [protection.office.com/antispam](https://protection.office.com/antispam) I've ensured that the bulk email threshold is set to '7' which is the default.
6. In [outlook.office365.com/ecp](https://outlook.office365.com/ecp) I've gone so far as to add a Spam Filter Bypass rule by setting that '[server@ourdomain.com](mailto:server@ourdomain.com)' gets the SCL value of -1 and is skipped over for the Spam Filter.
7. Mail is passing the SPF check
8. User has no special transport rules in place that might cause the issue

Despite  all that, the email gets sent, received by our system, bypasses the  spam filter, gets an SCL rating of 6 and is immediately routed to  Quarantine. What I find puzzling about the whole thing is how it can  bypass the spam filter (verified by checking mail flow) but come out the  other end with an SCL 6 (verified by the header)?

* DC firewall rules allow 1812 and 1813 in on UDP (automatically created by adding the NPS role)
* VM responds to ping from cmd so it is reachable.
* nmap shows TCP 1812 as filtered and UDP 1812 as open|filtered.

The issue I'm having is that we replaced our core NSA at our parent company's behest a week ago. This NSA has a bunch of IPSec tunnels that all have point to 1 server, and have a different NAT IP for said server in each tunnel. These tunnels send/receive very small amounts of data, like we're talking 500kb in a day being a large amount. I've checked and each tunnel has basically a miniscule amount of data coming through in any 24 hour period. Problem is that since the NSA has gone in, this server's performance grinds to a halt periodically throughout the day. The disks just max out and the server is completely locked up for 10-15 minutes, and then clears right up. This wasn't an issue with the old networking gear.

I was pulled in the middle of a project that I'm not all too familiar with, namely controlled validation process of a hybrid azure AD join rollout with AD FS in their environment.

The document above states the following:

\----------------------------

To do a controlled validation of hybrid Azure AD join on Windows current devices, you need to:

1. Clear the Service Connection Point (SCP) entry from Active Directory (AD) if it exists
2. Configure client-side registry setting for SCP on your domain-joined computers using a Group Policy Object (GPO)
3. If you are using AD FS, you must also configure the client-side registry setting for SCP on your AD FS server using a GPO
4. You may also need to [customize synchronization options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-post-installation#additional-tasks-available-in-azure-ad-connect) in Azure AD Connect to enable device synchronization.

\------------------------

Has anyone gone through this process before?  Is the Microsoft documentation sufficient for guidance on this topic, or is there more to it?

This was after about 2 weeks of radio silence where we really weren't sure that had happened. Due to privacy concerns, I'm not sure what befell him, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. His name was common enough that checking obituaries hasn't really helped either. While I didn't know him all that well personally, I wanted to share how I knew him professionally. We'll call him Bill.

Bill joined the project a few months ago which entailed upgrading all of a client's Server 2008 machines and my role was as an advisor who knew the most about the client's environment. The project was described to him of just doing the engineering of performing the upgrades and maybe working with users or vendors, but the reality was much different. The client didn't know their environment well and it would fall to us to discover all their servers, validate the hardware, determine applications/function, confirm that with the application owner, plan out an upgrade path, and then perform the actual work. Despite a couple of grumbles, Bill took it in stride and took on a more leadership role without being asked.

He helped us come up with how we were going to document everything, assisted the other contractors, came up with email templates, always worked on improving processes, and setup a software repository with ISOs and installation media for us to work out of. He rolled out a slew of scripts and tools he had used on previous projects such as the MAP tool and was able to use that to help supplement the information that we did have. He helped clean up their AD by removing all old DCs/metadata, upgraded all existing DCs, cleaned up their RDS licensing infrastructure, actually setup a KMS server and corrected all of the wrong product keys, uplifted their domain functionality, and moved them to DFSR for replication. All of this really fell into a gray area as far as the scope of the project, but Bill knew the importance of having a healthy environment to go into and was all about best practices. Honestly, I'm not sure any of those things would have happened if it hadn't been for him and was in addition to all the upgrades and decommissions he performed. I was never concerned I'd have to double-check his work and really appreciated his help with the project.

Bill understandably had some frustrations that he expressed to me and I know it caused him some stress and anxiety. The client's environment and ""best practices"" can't be used in the same sentence which didn't sit well with him. A lot of the things you might take for granted just aren't in place and he was constantly hitting roadblocks. I did my best to commiserate and make sure that he knew I appreciated him, but I knew it bothered him just the same. I had grown used to and somewhat blind to it having worked with the client for so long.

I guess I just wanted to share how much I appreciated him. He was a man who took pride in his work, was always willing to help, and was always looking to improve things. My only hope is that this project wasn't a contributing factor to his passing. I wouldn't think that it was affecting him too bad, but I just can't be sure.

We have quite a few servers that we can contact companies for help with due to SLA's, but we have just as many with no supports tied to them or no record of it.

Our documentation process has been almost non existent which doesn't help matters, so a lot of us aren't even sure completely what these servers do we've just had experiences where they break and we have to fix them. My question here is since the server name would change eg [server1.old.com](https://server1.old.com) to [server1.new.com](https://server1.new.com) if the IP address's remained the same, would that minimize possible downtime's? and if thats not a valid way to do things would you have any suggestions?

This issue has been posted 1000 times, but I can't find an answer that suits my situation.  
I have a esxi hypervisor with two VMs running 2012R2, both of which show ""No Internet"", even though internet works fine.  
The only reason this is even an issue is because one of them is a TS, and is causing Outlook/Office not to activate because it thinks there's no internet connection.

I have checked to make sure both servers can access the internet testing site, and retrieve the txt file successfully - for all intents and purposes the machines SHOULD show as online.

I have tried so many things now - including disabling IPV6 (which seemed to work for a bit until the problem returned a few days later).  
I have also tried resetting winsock and performing the netsh int ip reset commands (which didn't help at all).

Other machines on the network seem fine, so I think it could be NIC related.

Additionally, both VMs are using different kinds of NIC - one is e1000e, and the other is a VMX3 NIC.

Both seem to behave the same way in this case.

Let me elaborate on my confusing title. I want to set default applications at a GPO level which is all fine.

I was thinking that perhaps it would read the xml file sequentially and if I had the Reader association first, it would set that, then right under the Read association I have the line for the Adobe Standard association so if the computer has that installed I assumed it would default it to Standard and if not leave it at Reader.

1386,t3_gcmd38," TLDR: outsourcing can go very wrong without proper vetting and working with the IT department. Its best used sparingly in niche support situations for things your business can't manage not for cost cutting purposes.

This is going to be a very long post but my recent experience should stand as a warning to IT managers about outsourcing. I'm not totally against it in certain situations, I tend think it can work in two scenarios. When an IT team doesn't have the expertise or resources to do something cost effectively, I don't think it’s bad to outsource it but it should be a partnership just like any other vendor. The other situation is when a business is clueless, numerous people on this sub reddit have encountered a situation where they're the first real IT person, a bad MSP left a business out to dry, or you're taking over from a hostile and/or incompetent solo admin. 

I've used the same outsourcing companies for the last 5 years. One out of Bangladesh are a smaller family business less than 200 people, they invest in their staff, and from the get go the internal IT team was in control. It was well understood that we brought them onto support us not compete or replace us. The other company is a five person web developer shop out of Slovakia that handles our main web site it freed up resources from working on graphics and front end web requests. The relationship works and we've expanded our services with them as needed. 

This is in stark contrast to my recent experience with a large vampire IT consulting/outsourcing company. My company is large enough that IT teams become silos and have separate IT managers. One IT manager who previously worked for this vampire company made enough noise that he got approval to experiment with outsourcing the business unit he ran. Three and half months later they got booted for failing to provide adequate support

In my opinion I think the now former IT manager and vampire project managers did not really understand how you would operate an IT department or have situational awareness. They put way too much emphasis on ""metrics"" and cost cutting so they could get their bonus. I think they took full advantage of decision makers not being technical and made promises that were not realistic. Unfortunately for them this behavior lost them a customer we're not Barclays large but losing thousands of dollars does not bode well for them. 

Here's a lay down of all their warning signs.

1. They insisted on rushing through the takeover with no transition period

2. No information gathering was conducted by the vampires. They didn't ask exiting employees about their day to day job or for documentation. (I wound up doing this independently bribing people with pizza and drinks to get information because I suspected their failures would eventually fall back to the internal IT teams)

3. Competent IT people from the vampire company who were initially part of the project were either removed for pushing back or must have asked to be reassigned. Perfect example is day one of the hand off the vampires would be handling a particular support desk. An engineer brought up this wasn't plausible because they wouldn't have access to all the systems, and didn't have domain accounts yet. This person was no longer involved in the project after that conference call.

4. Vampire staff were extremely rigid on what they could and could not do. Everything is hidden behind bureaucracy and ticket tennis. Any issue requires unnecessary steps and people getting on a conference call. People treated the calls like echo chambers constantly asking the person next to them for guidance or permission to do something. This sometimes would go on for days. Laughably in one instance after my team discovered a security bug, a vampire joined a call huffing and puffing domineeringly telling a pm that my team needed to join the conference call to approve a change. I had to stifle laughter as I pointed out that we originally started the phone call and opened the support ticket to implement a patch because her team controls the maintenance of the application.

The final warning is kind of a story in itself but I think it’s worth mentioning what actually got this company fired. This business unit had a mainframe administrator who was part of the layoff let’s call him Popeye Doyle. Popeye Doyle had 40 years on the job, only career he's ever had. The day he finds out about the layoff he goes to HR and says I'm not interested in being out sourced or applying for a job at the vampire company. He told them I've maintained the mainframe without interference for years and without a problem. Either we work something out were I remain an employee of the current company or today is my last day I will retire rather than be outsourced. The vampires and the IT manager don't even meet Popeye Doyle half way. I know most of the time outsourcing decisions are made independently of IT and it’s out their control but I've been the primary technical person responsible for preventing/resolving several potential IT disasters in my tenure here. So I have some clout with execs. I warned the CISO and CFO that the vampires were flirting with disaster by firing Popeye Doyle and they needed to cover every square inch of their ass and plan accordingly if they wanted to survive the blast radius. I did my best to sound the alarm with the vampires that they were making a huge mistake. Eventually I dropped all civility in my emails sending something along these lines of: 

*“You guys have no choice but to come to a work agreement with Popeye Doyle, we cannot support this technology, we do not have a support person, I haven't seen evidence vampire company has a resource either, we don't know what core services are on that mainframe or how one would even logon. Frankly if something went wrong and we needed to get a consultant I'm not sure where we could find one, and how soon a consultant could realistically travel to fix the problem with the pandemic ongoing.”* The Vampire's response was so funny I printed it out and tapped it on a wall in my home office.

*"" Hello Lemmy Caution, you'll find that Vampire company has a lot of experience on these handover projects I know there’s always lot of friction and concern initially but we strive ourselves on providing customers with the best resources and you'll soon see we can provide more with less""*

You can imagine how this went. We were already not happy with the service we were getting but then Con Edison in New York accidentally drilled too deep into the street during maintenance and cut power to our building for almost two full days. Not a big deal we just an organized a shut down when it became obvious the outage would last longer than the UPS batteries. Except for the first time in 40 years we didn't have Popeye Doyle there to restart the mainframe. Turns out those mainframes contained a payroll system, payment process system, and a record application for a certificate program we issue anyone could call us and ask if we could validate that a person completed this certificate program. Once it became obvious we could be facing fines and serious trouble from the certificate issuing board the vampires went into full blown panic mode. They actually tried sending email blasts all over their global operation to try and find someone who could fix it. They brought in several consultants from other sections of the vampire operation but couldn't fix it. The full outage lasted seven days until they caved and called Popeye Doyle who basically got a down payment on a beach house somewhere in Pacifica, California for fixing the issue. This outage got the IT manager fired and the service agreement canceled apparently there’s a clause about the vampires being responsible for monetary loss &amp; errors/omissions but most importantly my company learned an expensive lesson on bad IT management/outsourcing.",Encountered IT Outsourcing Bad Practices Recently,r/sysadmin,0.95,144,80,{},1

So in order to give us something to do on top of the millions of code that we have to write she suggested that we gather every staff member's Office365 username and password and put them all on one Excel sheet just in case someone forgets their password. I gleefully ignored this and went about my day. Today I got a call from my manager demanding to see the Excel sheet. I told him we hadn't put it together because it was the dumbest thing I've ever heard, which seemed to tick him off.

I won't be party to this disaster waiting to happen..."". We got off the call and I was pretty convinced that he understood. 20 minutes later however, I got an email notifying me of my immediate suspension for insubordination and 'a general lack of desire to work with your fellow teammates...'

&amp;#x200B;

Situation: I have a Primary Domain Controller (2012 r2) that holds all the fsmo roles and its dying.

I have a handful of other vm domain controllers of which only 1 remains intact. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some research I realized the the fastest and headache-free way of saving this situation would be to transfer the fsmo roles of the physical domain controller to the surviving Virtual DC. Then spin up new dc's from scratch and let them replicate of this new fsmo king. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I plan to accomplish this: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transfer fsmo roles from the phsyical DC to the existing virtual DC. 
2. Demote physical DC
3. Instead of restoring VM DC's just create new DC's and have them pull the data from the VM now holding the fsmo roles. 
4. Clear the metadata of the decommissioned dc using ntdsutil.
5. Remove reference of removed server from DNS. 
6. Delete removed server from Sites and Services. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the other vm dc's they won't power on. So is there any special process I have to do to scrub them or will steps 4-6 work for them too ?

---------------------------

Oracle (Cloud). These certs all not that useful, but hey, I'll basically take anything when it's free. You can take each exam once. Must complete all tests by 5/15/20. 

Update: I'm not able to see open exam slots for most of these anymore. It's unlikely you will be able to register for an Oracle exam at this point. Seems they’re booked up. 

Free exams available (on Pearson Vue): 

Oracle Autonomous Database Specialist  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Operations Associate  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Developer Associate
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Associate
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Professional

More info, and links to register:

All multiple choice exams. 

---------------------------

Juniper Networks. Juniper's ""Open Learning"" program always allows you to earn free associate level exam certs (one time per track; there's 5 tracks). JNCIA-Junos is the hardest to get access to as it requires enrolling in a web course to earn the voucher. 

You can earn the other ones (JNCDA, JNCIA-Cloud, etc) through Junos Genius. You do have to complete the exam within 3 months of earning the free voucher. No rush on this in general though it's been available for a couple years now. Earning a JNCIA cert automatically extends expiration on all other JNCIA Juniper certs you have. So good to space these out over a few years. Multiple choice. Pearson Vue. 

Here's direct links to the Juniper options:

JNCIA-JUNOS: This one requires a special registration session and is capacity controlled. You can sign up for the 10/2020 session here while spaces are still open: https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=10175

Im interested in created a solution that consists of three parts

\-Ansible as a configuration management engine

Its more of a way to create a centralized user management system without LDAP or AD as the client cannot allow it.

Installing a CA-less FreeIPA server (on Linux) with self-signed certificates: feasible?

# Answer (for [FreeIPA server Ubuntu 18.04 package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/net/freeipa-server) install) = ""yes""

After generating `root_or_intermediate_CA.pem`, `ipa_http.p12` ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS\_12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) ) and feeding these files into the following `ipa-server-install` command, we have a *working* (confirmed in our environment) [CA-less FreeIPA server](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V3/CA-less_install) on Ubuntu 18.04... with the following workarounds to correct FreeIPA-on-Ubuntu-18.04 problems:

***FreeIPA bug workarounds*** *(for this system contexts; see versions below)*:

1. Prior to running `ipa-server-install`: [downgrade python's pyasn1 and pyasn1-modules](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyasn1/+bug/1785157).  ([Apparently fixed in FreeIPA 7.4.1](https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/7685#comment-533776); FreeIPA 4.6.90 is currently packaged with Ubuntu 18.04.4 per system info below.)
2. After running `ipa-server-install`:

On one server it works without a problem and previous shares was configured like this already. On the other server, I have created exact same folders with the same permission and the same group/members but it says that access is denied.

I also have created test folders to test it: Share permission is on ""Everyone"" with full access. NTFS permission is not inherited.

A specific group with my test user has the permission ""List folder / Read files"" on ""This folder only"" configured. Even when I add the user directly into the ACL, it does not work.

However, the same configuration does work on the second file server with the same OS and updates. Even with new created test folders.

But right now I'm focusing on how I can get the most out of what I already have before I go down that road.

What I'm try to do is maximize data transfer rates between two single Windows Server 2016 servers.

The servers have 4 x 1Gb network ports, Windows Server 2016 is installed on 2 SSDs in RAID1.  The SSDs are supposed to support up to 6Gbps transfer rates.  I've tried creating NIC teams with lbfoadmin as well as Switch Embedded Teaming.  Using these limits single host to single host transfers to 1Gbps.  (Though it does allow 4 x 1Gbps transfers if they are to 4 separate hosts).  I've also tried letting the 4 NICs operate independently, not in a team, and let SMB3 multichannel and RSS handle the transfers.  This has had the best results so far, even though each NIC only transferred around 600Mbps for some reason.  Unfortunately the network adapters do not support RDMA so I can't take advantage of that.

From what I've read the networking options will have the same limitation of NIC teaming.  LAG, etc, will permit multiple 1Gbps transfers but the max between two hosts is 1Gbps.

I'm not entirely sure this is the right sub to post this question, if not: please ignore :) I've tried my luck in r/ProWordPress, but got stuck there, as it is a server-specific issue.

This works great in my dev environment. However, after migration to the institute's server, Advanced Custom Fields can not save / update any field data. ACF support has helped me as much as they could, escalating the issue to the plugin developer, and his final findings were this:

""I have added some code to the ACF PRO plugin that will log out information during the ""save\_post"" action. This action should be triggered in two AJAX calls, however, on this site, it is only triggered once.

This explains why ACF is not able to update it's metadata.

As this issue only exists on a specific server, I believe it is safe to say that there is a ""security"" trigger or something similar at play preventing that 2nd AJAX call.""

I'm wondering if someone from this sub could give me any pointers where to look for the cause of this issue, as the institute's sysadmin has already tried everything he could.

Everything I tried seemed to not saturate the pipe very much and ultimately settled in on using multiple instances \`rsync\` to perform parallel transfers that seems to almost do the job.

This got me wondering: *are there competing tools with \`rsync\` that will automatically perform a parallelized / concurrent transfer for data?*

Even with this manually parallelized transfer of data there are always some variable children folders that end up having significantly more data than others and these only end up transferring at fractional speeds with \`rsync\` and thus the bandwidth saturation doesn't hold for the last hour or so of the transfer and if this weren't the case the window would be satisfied.

I even tried resetting the lamp hours through the OSD menu and the message that the bulb is near end of life still displays. After a few minutes the projector shuts off and the orange lamp of death displays on the panel where the buttons are. Dell was of little use with troubleshooting (since the projector is out of warranty) but they did send out a replacement bulb for the replacement under the bulbs warranty but that didn’t change anything. When that didn’t work, Dell pretty much said I was screwed and to buy a new projector. I have tried updating the projectors firmware and resetting it to factory defaults. Nothing seems to help.

* SIEM logs from the firewall and from our domain controllers, nothing by legit DNS traffic.
* No abnormal scheduled tasks on any workstations or servers.  
* Cylance Protect + Optics logs, no abnormal activity. No detected executables, no new scripts ran anywhere across the network. No hits on Optics. 
* Checked OWA + Netscaler logs, nothing abnormal. We have rate limiting and a WAF in front of both as well. Everything is 2FA w/ Duo. 
* Coordinated with out firewall vendor to see if they detected any abnormal network connections - no known malicious connections. 
* Checked AD for any modifications of the Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins and other sensitive groups, none. 
* Looked for abnormal password resets, none. 
* Checked for Keberos golden ticket. 
* No evidence of LSASS dumping

I'm the IT manager for a company that builds large custom machinery for automotive companies. I've been disappointed with our legacy ERP &amp; timekeeping systems since I got this job. The company is fantastic. We build and engineer everything in America- we make some of the coolest machinery out there. But we are stuck in the past.

Our machines take 6-12 months to design, and the same amount of time to build. These machines are the size of large houses in many cases. We are typically working on 3-8 of these machines at any given time. Everything is custom built to our customer's production needs, but we do keep a large stock of commonly used components.

These machines that we build have hundreds of tasks/ subassemblies, and they take such a long time to build that we haven't been able to find anything that actually works well. 

Ideally, I could create a new project only *one time* in this new- dream ERP. (As opposed to having to create and track all of the tasks/ subassemblies in 3 different programs.) The 100 or so tasks (allocated across the dozen or so subassemblies) that make up a full machine could sync with:

· Full featured project management module. Integrated Gantt charts are a must. (Schedule is very important, visibility on who is doing what over the months is critical). 

· Project based accounting. (Labor and component costs flowing into tasks.) 

· Timekeeping (Everyone from engineers to welders to logistics personell clock into the same tasks but charge different types of work to them.) 

· Resource planning (Departments/ people are allocated to taskbars within the project management interface; their commitments could be visible and the resource vould go red if it was overcommitted during a certain timeframe). 

Of course, I’m assuming the ERP would have standard modules for all other business needs. 

Other very nice to haves would be: 

* Cloud based. Maybe open source? Some options are just too expensive.
* Integration with- or inclusion of- mobile clock in app. We have many remote workers when we install these machines at customer sites. 
* Integration with- or inclusion of- invoicing / service-center module. We do a decent amount of aftermarket work for our customer base. 

I have looked at Oracle/ Netsuite a lot. It is just too expensive. Microsoft Dynamics is fairly expensive too- and really falls short on the project management side of things. Odoo maybe looks good, and all of the opensource stuff is much more affordable/ appealing, but I don’t know anything about opensource and it doesn’t seem like any of it is well suited for manufacturers who make huge always-custom things; just manufacturers who crank out the same goods over and over. Job-shop focused ERPs also seem to fall short on accommodating the length and amount of tasks and subassemblies that we produce. Meetings with Shoptech E2 &amp; JobBoss haven’t been great.

What can I do with this server? I'm not looking to make money off of it.

Here's what I came up with so far(these are all ""just because, they don't need to server a purpose):

 - A mailing server
 - Virtualize the server into n vps-es
 - A site of sorts(perhaps some file hosting site since it's got quite a bit of storage)
 - Some sort of kubernetes orchestration because why not

My goal is to learn a bit more about sysadming in general and I suppose this offers me that chance.

1445,t3_gc0g4y,"So here is a interesting situation I've ended up in. My company purchased the assets of a failed .com. Part of the assets are a software project that supposedly was 5-10% of dev work away from completion.   

My task today was to fire it up and check it out. The instructions I was able to get out of the previous developer was to just start the EC2 server instances, create a DNS cname record to the AWS load balancers in the project instance and it should come back up and be available. That is he said if no one had done anything to it in the year this thing has been in hibernation.   

Did that and of course nothing by 503 errors for my effort. I start poking around in the windows servers, load balancers and such and there just doesn't seem to be much there. 6 lambda functions, 0 instances in RDS but it is offering to restore stuff. The servers are little guys 16GB of RAM 100GB hard drives and 4 processors.  

Now here is the kicker, the failed company paid nearly $200,000 for this project. I'm a windows sysadmin on a good day and this is my first exposure to AWS. It's really neat to gain exposure to this tech and I'll certainly learn more, but today I need somebody to look at this and tell me if there is anything here, and if so how to get it linked back together and started.  

The previous developer wants a significant amount of money, like 40 dev hours to ""get back up to speed on this project"" and he told me not to expect any additional assistance unless we engage him. Odd attitude from somebody that I'd most likely be engaging to finish it up. It was developed to be a salable SaaS product.   

Is this something a astute AWS pro could look over in a couple hours and lay it out for me? Where would I find such a person and what is a fair price?

I'm a newbie. So, I was tasked with creating a new shared folder using DFS management under an existing DFS namespace. Sounds simple right? I had work instructions and everything. 

After creating the folder and target folder in DFS management, the instruction is to go to the folder's path in winexplorer to edit the its permissions and assign full control to an account/group **and then** set ""Everyone"" to Read Only. My dumb ass did the latter part before assigning the requested account/group. I cannot edit the permissions anymore. 

Such a dumb mistake. I tried to delete the folder in DFS and then create it again but the recreated folder's permissions remain the same, I don't know why. I even tried creating a folder with a different name and then rename it back to the old one, but the permissions is still set to read only to Everyone.

They currently have two clustered 2012r2 hosts with two mirrored NAS devices for VM storage.

There are two VMs in this cluster - An Application Server, and an AD server. Both are also 2012r2.

The new server is running 2019, and will not be part of a cluster. Our current plan is to export the VMs, then import them into the new hardware so we can turn the old ones on still if there are problems (I'm aware we can't turn the old AD server back on once it has been running on the new hardware).

The steps we've outlined are:

-Shut down VMs
-Merge any checkpoints
-Export VMs to shared drive on new hardware
-Import into new host
-Update Hyper-V services on VMs
-Boot App server and test before booting AD
-Decommission old hardware

We're going to rebuild the vms on 2019 afterwards, but for now the goal is to remove the unreliable hardware.

It's entirely possible I missed something.
If that's the case please point me at it.

## My Background

I've been working as a full-stack dev for over 5 years now.
During this time I've:

- wrote new applications from scratch
- worked extensively with Docker
- setup and maintained CI pipelines (Jenkins, Travis, and CirlceCI)
- deployed into and worked with a k8s cluster
- used some Terraform to provision the occasional DB

As you might see I know the basics.
I'm comfortable working with a CLI interface.

This also means that I have a hard time finding resources with a low ""signal to noise"" ratio on learning the Linux sysadmin ropes.

## What I've considered

During my research I came across a bunch of suggestions:

- everything on the [bootcamp page of the wiki][bootcamp]
- setup a Linux box from scratch, break it and try to repair it, do it again
- work through [Linux From Scratch][linux-from-scratcH]
- get a [linuxacademy][linuxacademy] subscription

Now these are all valuable suggestions!
But with my current know-how, I have a hard time determining which of these is the best point to start.

## What I hope for from you

As a father of two small kids, I __do not__ have a lot of time on my hand.
This means I would rather like to avoid delving into the ""wrong"" thing, to not ""lose"" a lot of the little time I have.

What I hope for is some feedback on where I get the best ""return of investment"" from where I'm standing at right now.
That might be you pointing at the list above, saying ""do them in the order you listed"", or maybe it's something totally different.
One way or another, I can more confidently begin to invest the little time I have into learning.

Please point me at something and tell me ""with your current know-how you best do _this_""

## What I want to learn

While I might be comfortable working as a full-stack dev, I'm totally lost when it actually gets to setting up and maintaining the underlying machines and networks.

At the end of this I would like to feel know how to:

1. setup a bunch of Linux boxes from scratch, be they bare metal or VMs (knowing which distro to chose, what software to install etc.)
2. configure a proper and secure network between said boxes
3. monitor the boxes and troubleshoot issues
4. keep the boxes up-to-date and secure
5. automate most, if not all of this

I expect that - after I got a good grasp of points 1 to 4 - point 5 will be quite simple.
After all automating things is basically my current job description.

I do not need to learn all this on an enterprise level - although I think I'll be able to expand into this area once I check all the boxes.
For now I would like to be able to do this at home and from there move to doing the same in a cloud environment.

I expect a good test would be to setup a k8s cluster from scratch, which would most likely include all the relevant skills.

I'm prepared that getting there will take months.

### TL;DR

I'm a dev with 5 years of Docker, CI, and backend dev experience with little time (2 kids).
Which resources on learning the Linux sysadmin ropes have a low ""signal to noise"" ratio with my current background?

It seems that using Gsuite or O365 with a cloud password vault could accomplish pretty much the same thing without the need of an external third-party IDP. And could reduce the complexity a bit since often a password vault may still be required.

I have a reseller account with a very important product that my customers purchase from me. The way it works is that I have a ""master"" reseller account and they have individual customer accounts. That way a customer can login and see their account status, pay their bill, etc.

One of my customers just had one of their employees resign (let's call her Stephanie). Stephanie was the one that paid that bill every month. Stephanie's replacement contacted me today asking how to get access to the portal so they could take over Stephanie's duties.

No problem. Login to reseller portal, change the contact information for the customer including the email address, and click the ""customer forgot password"" button in the reseller portal which sends them a link to change their password.

Or so I thought.

Stephanie's replacement forwarded me the email they got asking if it was legit. Good job. Always appreciate that especially if you're new and a random email is asking for you to click a link and set a password.

However, what shocked me was what was in the email.

I'm new to working with PubSec &amp; DoD contacts. In the past couple weeks I've had a few users report that emails from addresses ending in .mil are arriving to our inboxes as blank emails with the actual email as a .eml attachment.

1480,t3_gbjh2v,"I'm a DBA at a huge fortune 100 company. I support dozens of applications from different teams across the company and my work is a mix of issue support and helping implement new code/fixes to the it. Until recently my time tracking was simple. Company meetings were one bucket, Dev support is another, Prod support another, and then PTO.  It had been this way for years.

However recently our new parent company is pushing a standard for time tracking that makes no sense to me. Their standard is that a minimum of 50% of our weekly time needs to be charged to ""projects"" and not the dev or prod support. They've point blank said that if our team is not meeting this standard within a few months, we can expect a reduction in workforce because through their eyes it means we have too many employees. Whatever, seems reasonable, except:

\- Exec management have not communicated this to any of the application teams we support and won't be doing that. Not the exec that handles the development and systems departments, or our systems department to the application departments. It is our individual job as DBAs to let each customer we work with know that they now need to allocate budgeting, have a project manager go in and give me the ability to charge time against the project, argue with the PM about hours it took every week, and help them understand what a project is compared to baseline support. There is a doc only within our department about this, but we are not the same department as the many different application teams across the company.

\- Most of my customers don't even have a PM, project time/hours/ids in our system, or even the ability to use our time tracking system to allocate these hours to me to charge against. This past week for example, I must have spent at least 4 hours in meetings, emails, etc with just a single internal support customer trying to figure out how they can set up a project for me to charge time against, and the only answer I've gotten from anyone is ""oh we can't do that"". And it's only my problem, so no one else is following up.

\- Most of the customers are also not used to doing any of this for support. It has already been a struggle getting any of them to use our ticketing system instead of email or IMs. So far I've received confusion and anger from people who are mad because ""they never used to have to do any of this before"" and ""it sounds like a lot of paperwork.""

\- Management is not enforcing that we stop work for any teams that don't or can't do project hours. The teams don't care that I'm not able to charge project time, just that I keep working for them. My manager basically is just shrugging it off or saying ""yeah it's really annoying I wish they gave us better guidelines."" Ok great, well...

\- Some weeks there is just going to be a ton of support issues, and they don't at least on paper want us to track more than 40 hours a week. I've had weeks where I've done a full work week just handling people's issues. It sounds like I'm supposed to make up projects that don't even exist.

\- They are very vague about what a project is. For example if we help a customer having time out issues in their database and can easily identify an index that would help them, that is production support. If it ends up needing a deeper dive into their code that takes hours to debug stored procs and test, that becomes a project. It is up to me to randomly decide when it has crossed into ""project"" territory and start asking for project hours. I can just see that going great, explaining to a customer that their issue is suddenly a project that costs their department money when they are used to just getting all of my time for free, or when I did the same thing but in less time (because it was less complex or I was just awesome that week) it was baseline but now this new thing is a project.

\- It is now going to be an extra few hours a week just trying to keep track of this project stuff between tracking my hours, arguing with PMs or applications who don't consider something a project or the hours I want to charge, etc, for what is not a project based role (for example we still have on-call rotation and the expectation that all support work is prioritized over project work in terms of when it is done). And I am already very busy and not able to work in my own internal DBA projects as much as I'd like.

Is this the norm in corporate internal IT or am I missing something? I just want a job where I can show up, do my work, fill out a basic timesheet and get paid for my work. Not one where I have to explain to dozens of apathetic or cranky developers and business people they have to do paperwork and set things up for me to charge time against. Or be worried that me or someone on my team will be let go because I couldn't do anything when one of my customers says ""we don't have project hours.""

This is a problem with computer object's AD security group changes not processing at the client.

I am working with preparing Windows 10 1909.  I have a number of GPOs configured that use security group filtering to apply/deny.  I am pretty sure that there is no problem with the security filter based on the fix I found later and I am sure the problem is not AD replication issues.

When I add/remove a computer to/from an AD group and reboot, the computer is not processing that group memebership change correctly.  I noticed this because GPOs assigned to the newly added group were not being applied.  I ran GPResult and could see in the computer section's  security group information, that the computer was holding on to the *old* group memerships - even after an hour had passed and the computer was rebooted several times.  I thought at first maybe there was an AD replication problem but opening ADUC pointing to different DC, they all had the correct intformation.

But still GPResult was displaying old group memberships from earlier in the day.

Now, that is not a good situation.  We add computers to groups all the time to configure them in certain ways.  I cant have a case where making an AD group change doesn't take place immediately at  reboot.  Something.  Basically the idea was to open a system command window and delete/expire all the system's Kerberos tokens.  That did correct the problem.  This is why I don't suspect a problem with AD replication or a problem with the GPO security filters.  As soon as I flushed the Kerberos tickets, the client recomputed its group memberships and GPResult showed the correct information.

1518,t3_gbntu3,"Hey Everyone,

I know this question has been asked a ton, but most of the threads are &gt;7months old so thought I'd ask in case anything has changed.

Basically our situation is:

* We're a young company (&lt;10 employees) and plan to scale to \~20 in the next year or so.
* None of us have a background in IT, and we likely won't have someone with that back ground for at least 2 years.
* We're mostly BYOD, but we're going to start distributing Macbook Airs to employees who ask for one. It'll likely be 1 -3 computers over the next few months, and maybe 10 a year from now.
* To start, we're just going to use an MDM with company computers. Eventually we'll want to get all the BYOD devices (including phones) into our system as well, but that's likely well over a year from now now. 100% of company provided computers will be macs, but I imagine a few BYODs will be PCs (although it'll be a very small amount)
* I want to 80/20 security as much as possible. Employees access sensitive customer information via our CRM, but nothing is saved locally. My best guess for how we manage that is by:
   * Requiring devices to have a firmware + user login password that's complex
   * Encryption turned on
   * Maybe, something like Malware Bytes
   * Password manager and unique logins for everything (not related to MDM)
* Beyond that, I don't have the bandwidth to deal with requests from users — if someone wants to download Spotify they can and I don't care. A best case scenario is this is something I can set and forget.

Are there any strong recommendations for an MDM based on the above? Apple recommended Jamfnow and Mosyle, and I independently came across Fleetsmith — although Apple recommended against them.

Jamfnow is confusing and there's no demo, so I disregarded it, and Mosyle seems adequate. That said, Fleetsmith seemed great — it appears to just work and is intuitive (much like Apple products). Of everything, it appears that I could set and forget Fleetsmith the best, but I'm worried since (1) I don't see much about them on here and (2) Apple actually recommended against them.

I'm also worried Fleetsmith is a great choice for right now, but maybe will present a headache as we scale and need to change systems (but with no experience I don't know how much to value this worry).

       Wondering if anyone's ran into this issue before using DW. We have LDAP bind set up, specifically looking to a SG. Everything has worked fine, bind is successful and so are imports. The problem is I am working on a migration that has me moving users into a new OU. When they're moved to the new OU they can no longer successfully auth to DW using their domain credentials. If I move them back it works fine. Some info:

- Brand new accounts created in the new OU have the same issue, if moved to the old one they're fine
- the BIND is looking for a SG membership, this SG remains in the same OU it has always been and that is not the same as the original OU I am moving users from either so nothing changes with this SG
- Import is successful, always
- Removing from DW and reimporting making no difference
- Resetting the password for the user's domain account does not resolve it
- We have a cameraaccessonly OU that was created when we set this up, its for outside access. These users are fine too.
- The issue seems to be with the OU that was created after the camera system was set up
- bind is not searching any specific OU except the default users which is where the SG for membership sits

So for some reason users can only auth if their in the original OU, but for all intents and purposes it shouldnt matter. Nothing looks directly at that old OU, its looking for group memership and the group is not being moved.

My latest problem is that some of my users like to customise their quick access, task bar pinned items, excel/outlook options etc very heavily, but the settings they change don't apply to all the hosts.  
I haven't had any experience with UPD or UE-V (as I've only ever had one host to work with) but it sounds like they would work to fix that problem.  

To complicate things, we have folder redirection turned on for my documents, downloads, desktop to a file server but some users have appdata redirected, and some don't.  

I'm hoping for the users that DON'T have appdata redirection turned on, I can use UPD or UE-V so they can change settings and their appdata is saved to the central location and, for example, each host would have the same quick access stuff pinned. It wouldn't effect their normal workstation, all appdata changes would be contained in the RDS environment, and the folder redirection for Downloads/Desktop to the file server would work as normal.  

My concern is that for the people who DO have appdata redirected is that the changes they make to Windows and appdata on the RDS environment will mess around with their normal workstations, and UPD or UE-V wouldn't really stop that from happening.  

So I guess my question is, can I stop appdata redirection from applying to the new RDS environment, so it just uses an appdata folder than is on the UPD or UE-V and keeps settings away from their workstation.   

I feel like maybe I am overthinking this, or missing something obvious.

I hope all are well and safe. Please do correct me if im asking on the wrong sub the below query

We are a very small business enterprise into logistics with one server and 12 computers. I have two main queries for which i need your valuable advise. 

1. We have a server that runs the oracle data base and as of today the back of the database is on the server itself. In the past we had 2 ransomware attacks which led to us loosing data but luckily had data backup elsewhere stored. This also has led us to disconnect the server from the internet. The only valuable file on the server is the backup folder which is not more than 500MB. Could you please tell me a solution where i can backup this data securely to a cloud such that the backup is not overwritten with bad data if there is a ransomware hack to our server
2. What is the best way to access the server data from outside the office so that we can have our staff work remotely.

With regards to budget we are willing to spend around 1000-1500USD for the setup and around yearly around 1000USD as well

*Edit: Been doing some testing. Registry edit doesn't work on 1909. There is a better way, use secpol.msc*

In the absence of a VPN connection, when using some sort of remote assistance desktop sharing to administer the PC of WFH user you may encounter the problem of not being able to see a UAC for admin tasks.

This is because UAC normally appears on a separate secure desktop. You can force the UAC on to the user's desktop where you can see it by using secpol.msc to set 
Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation to Disabled.

~~following registry value:~~

~~HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System REG-DWORD EnableUIADesktopToggle = 1~~

~~But you cannot use Regedit to set the value even from the elevated command prompt because, you guessed it, UAC.~~


But you cannot use secpol.msc to set the value even from the elevated command prompt because, you guessed it, UAC. 

Now you don't want to give you user *your* admin credentials to enter into UAC, so here is a workaround:

Start elevated command prompt with RunAS

    c:\&gt;runas /user:example\user.name cmd.exe

In the elevated command prompt open local user manager

    c:\&gt;lusrmgr.msc. 

In local user manager create a throwaway temp user with a simple password and add to administrators group. Leave local user manager open.

Start Secpol

    c:\&gt;secpol.msc 

Get user to use the newly made temp user credentials in UAC for Secpol.

Set Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation to Disabled.

~~Start regedit~~

~~c:\&gt;regedit.msc~~ 

~~Get user to use the newly made temp user credentials in UAC for regedit.~~

~~Edit the EnableUIADesktopToggle value as above.~~

When done go back to local user manager and delete the throwaway admin account.

You will now have a UAC that you can see over your remote assistance tool.

____________________________________________________________________

Edit to add:

Some people are saying this or that tool avoids the problem. That is all well and good if the tool is/was available and that necessary work was was done ahead of time.

In the COVID-19 induced mass flurry of activity to get people to WFH, many machines have been sent home with less than optimal configurations.

I'm trying to get, in any form, the offline files cache limit (maximum amount of space offline files can use on a Windows computer) programmatically, when the limit is not assigned by Group Policy.

The easiest way that the data can be accessed is by going to Control Panel &gt; Sync Center &gt; Manage Offline Files &gt; Disk Usage. The information I'm looking for is the space available, in use, and/or limit, for ""All Offline Files."" If I can get two of these values I can calculate the third. However, the information here is only provided visually, and I can't figure out where it's sourced from.

From what I've found, there's a registry entry when the limit is assigned by group policy, but we don't set the limit through  group policy. Therefore, the value is generally within the \~25% of total disk space range unless we've changed it in the past on that device. However, that \~25% seems to have some pretty large fluctuation. (For instance, I have a device currently with a 200 GB C drive and a 38 GB limit.)

Finally, as mentioned in the stack overflow post, I have tried to use the Win32\_OfflineFilesDiskSpaceLimit WMI class but I'm not able to get any actual numbers from that. I can calculate the general space in use by getting the size of the CSC folder, but that doesn't tell me the allotment, which is really what I'm looking for (even as a percentage of the total drive size).

Our devices are all Windows 10, mostly running 1803. This is my first time posting here, so let me know if I can do anything to make this more clear. Hope I can get some help here. :)",Offline Files Disk Space Limit,r/sysadmin,0.71,4,3,{},1

Currently, I'm manually switching the inputs on each of my monitors individually (two inputs running to each, one from each device) and manually swapping the peripherals to each system as needed. This is obviously extremely time-consuming and disrupts my workflow every time I need to switch between systems (which happens frequently).

I've found a couple that get really close, but I want to make sure I've turned over every stone before pulling the trigger on one of those. Any help/guidance would be much appreciated.

**Setup:**

* 3 Displays
 * 1x 1440p 144hz G-SYNC (DisplayPort 1.4)
 * 2x 1440p 60hz (DisplayPort/HDMI/USB-C)
* Personal PC (RTX 2080 Ti, DisplayPort 1.4)
* MacBook Pro 2018 (USB-C)
* Dell WD19TB Thunderbolt Dock (2x DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI, MFDP USB-C, TBT3 USB-C)
* Headphones (3.5mm Audio Jack/USB)
* Corsair K70 Keyboard
* Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse

**KVM Switch Requirements:**

* At least two total display outputs
 * At least one DisplayPort 1.4 output
* Use same keyboard/mouse for both systems*
* Use same audio device for both systems (with no interference)*

**KVM Switch Nice-to-Haves:**

* Built-in EDID Feeding/Emulating
* Three total display outputs (three inputs or integrated MST hub)

**Planned Hardware Setup (Ideal):**

* 2x DisplayPort 1.4 from Personal PC to KVM Switch
* Thunderbolt from Macbook Pro to Dell Thunderbolt Dock
* 2x DisplayPort 1.4 from Dell Thunderbolt Dock to KVM Switch
* 1x DisplayPort 1.4 from KVM Switch to 1440p 144hz Monitor
* 1x DisplayPort 1.4 MST Hub from KVM Switch**
* 2x DisplayPort 1.4 from MST Hub to 1440p 60hz Monitors**
* Keyboard, Mouse, and Headphones from KVM Switch*

*Alternatively, would I be able to run these through the USB passthrough on the monitors? Not entirely sure if that would work, but if it does, this requirement is moot.

**These technically don't need to be DisplayPort 1.4 connectors.

I know incorporating so many different pieces of hardware in one setup like this can cause massive headaches with setup and sometimes lead to compatibility issues, but I'm not entirely sure what my alternative is. From what I found online, my options were either a dual display DP switch, a quad display DP switch that supports up to four systems, or a triple display DP to HDMI switch. Everything I've read has indicated that using an MST to split one of the signals from the KVM switch shouldn't cause any issues.

I found two solid options while looking around on reddit and other sites ([ATEN CS1942DP](https://www.aten.com/us/en/products/kvm/desktop-kvm-switches/cs1942dp/) and [StarTech SV231DPDDUA2](https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/2-port-dual-dp-kvm-switch~SV231DPDDUA2)), but reading reviews online, they both seem to have issues with either audio passthrough or transmitting the full bandwidth required for 1440p 144hz. These are both dealbreakers for me, unfortunately. I was also pointed towards the [Level1 DP 1.4 Dual Monitor KVM Switch](https://store.level1techs.com/products/kvm-switch-2-port-dual-monitor-8k-model). This one looks the most promising, but I just want to make sure there are no other options out there that have integrated EDID feeding (the Level1 does not). I know KVM switches are typically unreliable and difficult to set up properly, but I'm hoping someone here might be using one that they've found to work well.

It was a unit that was a duplicate system from work that we had no need for, so I was lucky enough to inherit it.

I'd like to use it in my home and as an esxi environment. I've built it as such and it runs great. However, the fan noise from the D3600 is just a bit much for my house. There is nothing wrong with either the server or the enclosure. Both are patched to the latest versions, cleaned from dust using canned air and wiped down clean. The noise clearly seems to be coming from the two power supplies that are in the unit. It has two fans that are fixed back-to-back. If I pull one out, the other one revs up to compensate, thus creating more noise. The unit will not run if I pull both of them out. 

I realize that this is a unit designed for maximum airflow and to live in a datacenter. There may not be anything that I can do about the noise.

We recently signed on with LogRhythm to replace a former solution which was using Snare.

Secondly, I tried to put that same command into a ""scheduled task"" and have it trigger on vm startup, but that same command fails to map the drive.

I'm looking into ways of automating Windows Server patching, and not just the actual patch installation and rebooting. I would like to find a good orchestration/automation tool that would allow us to set up specific rules about which hosts to patch first, and also allow us to set up a series of checks after patching is done. 

For instance, our Lync pool would need to only be patched one server at a time, and between patching and rebooting of each server, a check would need to verify that the fabric health is OK. Once all servers are done patching a final check on the fabric health would be needed as well.

The last step I am not sure how to figure out is how to connect it to the domain to allow the user to log in and automatically create the mobile account.

My current solution is to set up a local user that can be logged in, connect to the VPN, log out and then back in as the mobile user account - but this feels like a pretty terrible process to explain to a senior member of staff.

1633,t3_gb858t,"**I'm an independent contractor.** One of my clients wants me to download employee monitoring software on my personal computer to track my time and activity - the software is ""Hubstaff"". 

Recently, things have been tense with this client because they're refusing to pay me the rate they had agreed to. I don't want to cause any further issues with them while I sort out the payment issue, so I'm planning on downloading the software.

HOWEVER, I find it a complete invasion of my privacy that they want to log my keystrokes and take screenshots while I'm tracking time. **Is there a way to block the desktop Hubstaff app from doing this? Or possibly remove those permissions? I'm using a 2013 MacBook Pro running macOS Catalina.** 

They've specifically requested that I use the desktop app because the browser and iOS versions don't take screenshots. My top concern at the moment is that I don't want them to be able see rough drafts of the emails I'm sending them because, like I said, things are a little tense.

I also believe employee monitoring software is unethical. When I'm working on projects (I'm a graphic designer &amp; animator), I spend time away from my computer just thinking, or sometimes sketching out ideas, but still using brain power dedicated toward my project. Something like Hubstaff would flag this as an inactive period. This is just one reason, among many, that I would prefer to not use the software. However, if I bring these issues up with my client I'm worried that they'll drop my services and not pay me the money that they currently owe me.

EDIT:
For anyone else who’s facing this problem: it looks like there’s no real technical solution. A VM might work if you know how to set one up correctly, but from my understanding there’s a lot of potential for that to go wrong. 

After some extra research, the best solution I could find was to inform my client that by using employee monitoring software I would be putting my other clients’ information at risk. If the software took a screenshot of another client’s internal files or company information I could potentially breach my NDA. I then informed them that I’d be willing to use the software if they sent me a separate work computer - which I really doubt they’ll want to go through with (thanks for the suggestion). 

This isn’t a perfect solution either but at least it gives me an arguably better reason why I’m refusing to use the software. 

Also, for those of you wondering why I’m not pushing back more: this is my biggest client - the work I do for them brings in over half my monthly income depending on the month. We’re also in the middle of a pandemic right now and everyone’s quarantined (at least in my state). No one else is hiring. 

This was also one of my most reliable clients up until the end of this month. I would never have guessed they’d put me in this position. Economic instability does interesting things to people.",PLEASE HELP - How to block employee monitoring software?,r/sysadmin,0.41,0,26,{},1

1650,t3_gaz622,"Hello! I am a beginner sysadmin with limited (mostly Linux and FreeBSD) experience. I have been working with a client that has a small office, \~10 people with an upcoming expansion to a total maximum of 20.

&amp;#x200B;

We have redone and reconfigured their network and have put a pfSense router, a FreeNAS server and an XCP-NG hypervisor in place.

&amp;#x200B;

The client is really keen on not losing data and not having downtime. He is willing to spend a bit more for the sake of everything being safe and working correctly and is quite tech-savvy so he is really nice to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

His employees are using regular Windows 10 workstations, mainly for: 

1. the Office Suite 
2. A proprietary business CRM-like software that is hosted on a Server 2016 machine (that will be converted to a VM soon) and has a Windows 10 client program 
3. Web browsers

&amp;#x200B;

Since the employees are not really keen on backing up their stuff to the FreeNAS server or the cloud (Dropbox), we have been looking for a solution to make sure no data is lost and no downtime occurs due to workstation hardware failures (which would most commonly be a drive failure).

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been thinking of repurposing the current and future workstations as thin clients, possibly with the implementation of an AD DC and automatic mapping of all the usual Windows directories to FreeNAS SMB shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, going with a server-side based solution would allow us to use used thin clients, raspberry pis or something else that is low cost and low power for the upcoming office expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to keep to FOSS as much as possible, mainly due to cost.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have been thinking about:

Boot the clients to openthinclient or thinstation from the network and use RDP or Spice, depending on what we will go for.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario A:

Build a sort-of VDI solution, based on either XCP-NG or Proxmox with VM storage on FreeNAS. Going with KVM could open the path to using Ravada VDI or something similar for a FOS VDI broker, use spice, or implement hardware GPU acceleration with the help of an AMD S7150X2 since it supports SR-IOV on Linux. We only really need a base image and VM clones and we would probably tie it to a Windows or Samba AD DC or other solutions such as Zentyal. We would probably need to buy a dual or quad Sandy or Ivy Bridge used CPU server.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario B:

Deploy Windows RDS from a Windows 2019 server, either physical or virtual. Problem is, I have no idea how Windows RDS works, if I can use Linux clients for it, what kind of limitations it has and what kind of hardware + licensing I would need.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Does Spice suck?
2. Does RDP suck?
3. Would you go through the hassle of implementing HW graphics acceleration and for what reason? (VDI scenario)
4. I absolutely need low-level USB redirection. AFAIK that means I need to either use spice or RemoteFX. Does RemoteFX even work with hypervisors other than Hyper-V and clients other than Windows?
5. Would you go for A or B and why? Is it too much hassle?

We are using a self-signed cert, not a public trusted SSL cert. That being said, since setting up the CA, we're still getting the 'Your connection is not private' warning when visiting websites that reside within our domain/intra-net. Is there a fix for this without purchasing a Trusted SSL Cert from a provider? What I have verified:

1.) The CA Cert is being pushed to the devices in question

2.) Our domain CA is in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities section for the assets in question

3.) The assets in question have personal certs issued (not expired) from the CA

I feel as though there might have been some kind of setting/configuration I may have missed when creating the initial cert to begin with as my understanding is that any domain asset should still be trusted by virtue of the domain CA being a trusted root ca.

Edit: Following u/OhioIT's advice, I was able to get the issue resolved. See below:

I was getting a ' NET::ERR\_CERT\_COMMON\_NAME\_INVALID' error due to the incorrect configuration of the cert applied to the web server. This was because the cert being used didn't have the appropriate 'Subject Alternative Name' (SAN) entries. So how did I fix it?

1. On the CA server, I cloned the Web Server Template and adjusted the compatibility to the oldest server/workstations in our environment (2012/Windows 8.1) and on the Cryptography tab, I selected 'Requests can use any provider available on the subject's computer'. In the security tab, I added the two servers that would be using the cert with read/write/enroll permissions enabled and saved it.
2. Also on the CA server, I issued that template within certsrv
3. On the IIS servers, I opened MMC and under the Personal/Certificates, I requested a new certificate. I selected the new web server cert.
4. **(IMPORTANT)** For the uninitiated, make sure you check the following:
   1. 'Subject Name:Type' was set to 'Common Name' and I entered '[server.contoso.com](https://server.contoso.com)' and added it.
   2. 'Alternative name: Type:' was set to DNS and I entered just the dns name without the domain attached (example: server, not [server.contoso.com](https://server.contoso.com)) and added it.
   3. 'Alternative name: Type:' was then set to IP which auto filled the server's IP address and added it
   4. 'Alternative name: Type:' was finally set to URL and I added the URL's that would be used by the websites and added. 
   5. on the General tab, I added the friendly name and description for ease of finding the cert when applying it in IIS.
   6. Then I finished enrolling the cert and it was then available for IIS to use.
5. In IIS (Internet Information Services Manager) I selected the Default Web Site under the ServerName/Sites/ folder and selected Bindings -&gt; 443 -&gt; and selected the appropriate server which was easy using the descriptors i set in the steps above. 
6. Then I restarted the website and blammo: Cert works!

Up until a couple of days ago, things were printing fine, now all of a sudden we are unable to print anything. Documents will briefly spool and then disappear from the queue. If a printer is set to keep printed documents in the queue they will show as printed instantly after they finish spooling no matter how many pages are supposedly printed (I've tried upwards of 1600 pages).

Here's the troubleshooting I've tried so far:

* Ensured Print Server has the latest Windows Update
* Uninstalled the most recent non-security updates since problems started (and shortly before)
* Restarted Server
* Restarted Print Spooler service, both using the restart option and simply stopping and starting it
* Ensured printers print on their own; both configuration pages and USB direct connect
* Tried printing from Multiple computers, including the print server itself
* Shut down print spooler and cleared everything out of System32\\spool\\PRINTERS
* For one of our multi-purpose printers I:
   * Created a new printer and port to it's IP address
   * Tried literally ever latest Windows 10 Driver available on the manufacturer's site
   * Tried every Print Processor
   * Unchecked ""Render print jobs on client computers""
   * Unchecked ""SNMP Status Enabled"" in the port configuration
   * Set it to print only after all pages are spooled
   * Unchecked ""Print spooled documents first""
   * Checked ""Hold mismatched documents""
   * Set a new IP Address

The only major change since this problem arose was a change to the permissions, but as far as I can tell the permissions are set up correctly and this doesn't sound like a permissions issue because there's no permissions errors and documents are spooling correctly.

Any new suggestions are welcome because I've run out of ideas and at this point we are considering just rebuilding the thing on physical hardware to see if Hyper-V is causing the issue.  


EDIT:

Figured out the problem. Turns out it was a permissions issue. We had removed the Everyone group from the Print Server Properties ACL while setting up our new groups in there. The problem is that the Service group isn't included in the ACL by default meaning that while everyone had permission to print, and were able to spool documents correctly, the print spooler service itself didn't have permission to print. 

After giving the Service group permission to print we were good to go.

I'm the ICT lead in a small company employee wise. We're big enough to have about 7 directors though. These directors are based  in the UK, so we have a time difference (we're -4:00). These directors also own their own devices, and only some of them have and use our corp email because they have their own thing going. Think the rich, globe trotting type.

Now it has always been a challenge with these guys n gals. They don't pay much mind to the tech side of things, yet still expects to have communication benefits. And of course, the department's still fully responsible for them being able to communicate well. To add to this, some use Apples. 

So the scenario is this:  As some of you would know, MS offered 6 months O365 E1 for free to help with comms during the current pandemic. We took this offer to be able to use Teams and is in the middle of deployment. 

I took the responsibility of emailing each user with guidance and links, as well as end user training videos and I copy one of the support staff to further help with Anydesk and the installation. Brent, one of the support team's especially bothered by the extra responsibility we have over these directors, and maybe it's my mistake for letting him in on the current deployment.

Brent's wife started spiking his coffee with Jack Daniels for fun yesterday morning, until he went full Jack n Coke. by 10am, Brent's proper. I did not know this at the time.

Adrian, one of the directors, responds to our initial emails, saying he logged in, changed his password, installed Teams on his Mac, and now it's stuck on initializing. He asked what could be the problem and what could he do to progress.

Brent responded to the email with ""F*ck knows..""

My wife was home yesterday and we share a big desk. She said she saw me turn white.

I immediately called Brent and while asking him what the hell, the managing director calls me to ask what the hell. Adrian forwarded the email to him.

The managing director was furious. He said he was calling HR after, and prepare to start the protocol to change admin passwords, Brent was out.

I called Adrian after, apologizing profusely for the response he got, and telling him I'm putting someone else from support on it for him. His response was ""What was he drinking?"". 

This dude's so lucky. Adrian said that he knows that IT would be under pressure with the work from home shift, and he understands Brent. Said next time he's in the country for a personal board meeting he'll take him out for some Jack. The MD still got him a week's suspension without pay, and Brent doesn't care because he's saving on the commute anyway. 

So now I'm short 1 support staff, who welcomes his vacation, and somehow it's still my fault for not controlling them.","Didn't think it needed to be said, but here we are..",r/sysadmin,0.91,899,432,{},1

* Updated everything (OS, Office, Drivers?) 
* Logged the user's work account, logged back in.
* Ran the repair tools for Office
* Cleared out and reset all internet settings in IE
* Double checked time settings
* Checked DNS
* Turned off security settings in Office (turned them back on after)

I run a medium sized engineering business and have been bitten hard by IT “companies” in the past. I now do all of my own IT and it takes up pretty much most of my week. 

I’ve been charged astronomical rates by “professional IT” companies who I feel like are hijacking my credentials and locking me into service contracts and undertaking IT tasks that I can do in half the time myself. 

Our IT systems are, I guess, a little more complex than usual (but I don’t know for sure). Windows servers for distributed file systems across multiple sites, license servers for engineering softwares, multiple VPN’s for redundancy for offsite workers (COVID-19 forced but working well now), in house development and stage servers for Software engineering teams, AWS for production servers, 30odd workstation PCs and laptops, security systems, and probably more. 

I would love to hire someone to do the job, but feel it isn’t really a full time job, although it may actually be!?! And definitely cannot justify exorbitant “IT consulting” costs, for something I could do myself out of hours and have a few thousand dollars per day more in my pocket instead of giving to “IT company”.

Unplugged and using in-band mgmt now.

Now I just need to find a battery for controller 1 to replace since there was a warning it was missing on the RAID controller in MDSM. No bueno.

======================

First off, I'm a complete noob with SAN/NAS/Storage arrays so apologize in advance.  I've [RTFM](http://downloads.dell.com/Manuals/Common/powervault-md3200_Deployment%20Guide_en-us.pdf), (not sure I fully understand it, but I've read it) and searched all over the Internet for help and clues.  Inherited a ""project"" and am not a storage guy, but since I am the only person on the team that is somewhat proficient with \*nix I got stuck with it.

Setup (from what I can tell):

R720 with (2) LSI PCI-e SAS cards

    03:00.0 RAID bus controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic MegaRAID SAS 2208 [Thunderbolt] (rev 05)
    06:00.0 Serial Attached SCSI controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS2008 PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS-2 [Falcon] (rev 03)

Powervault MD3220:

SAS cable connected from array RAID controller 0 to R720 HBA card 1 and controller 1 to HBA card 2. (I don't know if this cabling is right but when I powered on the MD3220 the light finally went blue instead of flashing orange)

Nothing else plugged into MD3220, *management port is not being used*.  No other host will have access to the storage array.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've done so far:

Re-imaged the OS, using the PERC raid and local drives to the R720 for storage.   Installed Dell MCCS and ran it, during auto discovery it says *no arrays were found*.

Q1) Is the management port (192.168.128.101) **absolutely** required for direct attached? My understanding was that you could have it use In-band management...

Q2) Do I have to assign IP addresses to the SAS ports?  And if yes, how, what iface are they?

I can see the MD32xx in the /proc/scsi/scsi so I'm not sure what else I need to do for the MCCS to see the array so I can create and format partitions that the OS can see and use.

I'm trying to get rid of some phantom proxy server settings on multiple Win10 computers. We do have a proxy server, but are trying to decommission it. However, multiple computers keep connecting to it and I can not find what is pointing them there.

There doesn't seem to be a proxy set, but a packet capture clearly shows traffic being sent to our old proxy server by Outlook and IE (and Chrome). If I disable proxy auto detect, things work normally, but if I re-enable it, traffic again goes to the proxy.

What I've tried:

1. Check if wpad and wpad.&lt;domain&gt; are resolvable. They are not.
2. Check both DHCP servers to see if they are handing out proxy autoconfig urls. They are not.

At this point, there should be no proxy auto-config, but it is still occurring. So I dug deeper:

1. Win 10 -&gt; Settings -&gt; search for Proxy -&gt; Proxy  Settings. The only thing on is automatically detect.
2. Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options -&gt;  Connections -&gt; Lan Settings. The only thing on is automatically detect.
3. Went through every GPO looking for a proxy being set. Nothing.
4. Searched the computer's registry for the port the computer is using to talk to the proxy. Nothing with the proxy server's name or address.
5. Looked at the start up scripts. I did find one that sets HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Connections\\DefaultConnectionSettings which could contain proxy server settings hex encoded. However, commenting that out in the script, removing the setting from the computer and rebooting did nothing. It also was almost all 00, so it is unlikely that was doing it.
6. Checked C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\Custom\\ and C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Internet Explorer\\Custom\\ for possible custom file (which can be created from the IEAK). Nothing.
7. Checked \`netsh winhttp show proxy\`. No proxy set.
8. Did a complete reset of IE, hoping it was a case of a correct setting that was actually wrong. No change.
9. Attempted to disable the proxy via powershell reg edit: \`set-itemproperty 'HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings' -name ProxyEnable -value 0\`. No change.

Any ideas?

**Update:** Searching through the computer's registry, I came across a key WpadDetectedURL with an old auto proxy config file. I say old because I deleted it myself. But lacking any other ideas, I tried the url in Edge. It let me download the file!

So I went back and checked the server it was originally hosted on. Yes, it is gone. In fact, the webserver itself is turned off. A tcp-ping confirmed that. Maybe, since the proxy is still on, the proxy was serving up a cached copy of it? So I reset the proxy's cache and I cleared Edge's cache. But I could still download the file.

So I cleared Edge's cache again and ran tshark. Then I proceeded to successfully download the file again. Looking at the packet capture, I can NOT find any get request for it nor that file name in any of the packets (download is http, not https). Wireshark's export http objects doesn't show it either. So I was able to download a file without downloading it??? WTF!?!? (Yes, I captured on the correct interface. There were other objects I captured from other tabs in Edge mandated by corporate policy.)

As a sanity check, I attempted to repeat the download \[via Edge\] on a computer that is not having the problem. The download failed as it should have.

**Update 2:** Resolved (not solved). I deleted the key WpadDetectedURL, and changed the keys WpadDecision to 0 and WpadDecisionReason to 1 under the same parent. Rebooted and machine is working fine. I did find there was more than one WpadDetectedURL, so you may have to do this more than once. The keys were under HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Wpad\\&lt;some guid&gt;\\

I never did figure out where that file was being ""downloaded"" from.

I have 4 Chrome windows with a distressing amount of tabs open (even for my standards), and I think I've made sense of our plan, but need another set of eyes with more experience in this world.

Our needs will be spread over 3 products: Office 365 E1, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, and O365 E3.

Basically E1 for people/things that just need email, M365 BP for most everyone, and O365 for power users or C-levels.

 I have the homemade [Microsoft Licensing Matrix](https://infusedinnovations.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Public/EcWcoHQRZzVNnoo8GAYLqDwBj01kz2j3VKXaJHNOhFZQjw?e=3insKx&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdbipreview=true&amp;wdHideSheetTabs=True&amp;wdHideHeaders=True&amp;ActiveCell=Matrix!D4&amp;Item=PublicContent) that's been passed around, but it hasn't been updated to reflect the new M365 plan changes (neither has a lot of Microsoft's documentation).

It seems like the only meaningful limitations of M365 BP compared to O365 E3 are a 300 license max, reduced mailbox and onedrive storage, as well as limited DLP, eDiscovery, and in-place hold features. Otherwise, M365 BP has ATP P1, full Azure P1 is rolling out, and because we're a nonprofit, comes in at half the cost of O365 E3 with those add-ons.

Right now our AD is all on-prem. We'll use Azure AD Connect to sync the two directories, and once 365 is off the ground, introduce Duo to work with Azure for MFA &amp; SSO.

We use GPO to redirect the users Documents and Desktop folders to their network home directory and Offline files to sync that directory to the user's local laptop.  Both of these policies were created prior to my starting at my company and prior to the work from home situation, they have always ""just worked.""

Now what is happening is when a user is working from off network, their desktop icons get a grey X in the corner of them indicating that the offline file is unavailable when they could have been perfectly fine the day before also working remotely.  If we go to the Sync Center the status will say Sync Pending but never do anything, even when reconnected to VPN.

Back when I had direct access to the system I disabled the Offline Files GPO and when connected to the network the desktop icons worked just fine.  Reconnecting the GPO would make the files break again when the laptop was taken off of the network.

What I've been doing every day is watching learning videos on every topic for about 6 hours and not just putting a video on and vegging out but actively taking notes, researching concepts, etc.  Sites like LinkedIn Learning, YouTube, and some other free or lower cost sites.   Everything from Linux to Server 2019 to Python to networking to photography to beer making.  Honestly I'm liking it.  I never got a chance to keep up with technology and the ex-job was not particularly keen on us carving out time for learning so I learned on my own when I had time, which wasn't a lot.  I have ESXi and VirtualBox on two machines and have been setting up virtual labs, OS's and just enjoying my time learning.

I figured I would take a 4-6 months and use that time to learn but how do I express this to potential employers in the future?  I've seen, and have had headhunters pass me jobs that I was well qualified for that I just ignored.  I'm just not ready to go back yet.  I guess I just say nothing was what I was looking for?

I suppose I'm just curious how others would handle this situation?   Are there any learning sites you could recommend?  Should I be going for a certification?  We have savings, but I don't know if spending on more expensive training would benefit me at my age?  I'm worried that the longer I'm not working will look bad on my resume or would people understand from everything going on?  Is 50 old or too old in IT?  I'd love to move to management but all my history has been hands-on work.

Alittle background of the small company is they have 3 small office and currently have no VPN between the offices.  They do have a local NAS in each office that they store files and use O365 (moving files to Sharepoint).  Currently they use a wireless router they bought from walmart at each location. For switching they use a netgear they bought off Amazon.  They don't have any webfiltering and use the windows 10 built in AV.

If you were building a network from scratch what provider would you use.

Firewall (Would like Webfiltering/VPN/Malware/IPS scanning)  
Switches (Don't need POE as they use teams for voice)

Access to their work systems has been realized through RDP but the telephone solution we've create (more or less on the fly) is still lacking.

For the moment we forward their work extensions to their (personal) mobile phones via Single Number Reach.

At their office they use a Cisco Callmanager and (mostly) Cisco 7821 phone with a headset attached to the phone.

Before the Covid-19 crisis they have been testing with a softphone configuration (via Cisco Jabber) which worked well enough at their office, but due to the big difference in quality available PCs and laptops which are mostly personal and not company issued they don't see softphones being a good solution.

This leaves a hardware solution in which they could plug their deskphones into. Such a solution would have to overcome a few key issues:

* great variety in internet connections
* mostly no fixed IP addresses
* most users don't have any cabling but just work via WiFi from their kitchen table
* some kind of VPN is needed, exposing a Cisco Callmanager to the internet is akin to suicide

So I have come to the conclusion that I need a magic box that can do/must have:

* OpenVPN client
* Function as WiFi client/bridge
* PoE to power the phone (not a show-stopper if not)

And I'd need approx. 40 of them, so availability is also an issue. Oh, and of course it needs to be 'budget friendly' (whatever that means).

The magic box idea has been abandoned. Setting up MRA would be the ideal solution but for now we're going with OpenVPN to get Jabber connected.",Looking for complex WFH phone solution.,r/sysadmin,0.83,4,33,{},1

Just wanted to know if anyone had dealt with the same situation and what approach have been taken:

An employee is laid off and we want to prevent any access to the data on the device in order to prevent leak.

We have pretty much all control in place, Bit-Locker, USB mass storage and Bluetooth. We can also network contain the device in order to not connect to any network (to transfer mass data to a home samba share for example)

The thing is, we want to prevent user to still login on the device offline. (since windows do cached AD credentials). User will have access to the data still and will be able to take screenshot with a phone for example.

**So the point is:** is there any way to force AD sync or remove cached credentials locally on the device? Is there some sort of way to script that or remove registry key?

1774,t3_gfzbj2,"So here's my weird situation,

I have a handful of remote computers in my network, that when I try to ping, I get destination unreachable. If I try to do nslookup, it returns an IP address that isn't even in my IP space (the first octet of the returned IP is correct, but the second is way out of bounds). I do know that it has a good IP, these tools just think it has a different IP for some reason. I also can't RDP the system through hostname or IP either, nor can I get powershell to do anything to them remotely (enter-pssession, any command with ""-computername"" parameter, etc all fail to connect, but I can remote powershell normally to systems that don't have this issue).

If I physically go to the remote computer, and do an ipconfig on it, I see it's REAL IP, and there are no connectivity issues. I can also remote back to a server successfully, ping a server, browse the web, etc. The users of these problem computers haven't noticed anything and aren't complaining, but this has probably been an issue for quite some time.

I need to get this fixed because although the users are able to do everything they need to do, this DNS issue seems to be what's causing these systems to also not be getting their security updates correctly and it's showing on our vulnerability scans.

I feel like it's gotta be something DNS related, but because (seemingly) the hostname resolves to the incorrect IP, I can't do ipconfig /flushdns or /release &amp; /renew, etc. without physically going to each one of these systems and doing it manually.

It's gonna be a huge hassle if I have to track down each one of these manually - does anyone know of a way that I could remotely flushdns or something that I could just try? Everything on Google is saying ""It's easy! just invoke-command -script {ipconfig /flushdns} -computername 'cpname'"" 

But the -computername parameter for any powershell command fails on these computers, probably because it's resolving to the wrong IP.
