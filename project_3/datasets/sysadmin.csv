The Town Hall continued much as it usually does, until we got to the Awards section. There amongst the list of nominees was me, but much more ""surprise and delight""fully **and importantly** was 'IT Team'.

A huge amount of work has gone in over the last year and a half, and having the team recognized in this way was a real moment of pride for all of us.

\-----

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

We're still a long way off where we need to be, but at least now we know for sure that we're going in the right direction.",t2_zti1a,False,,1,False,IT got recognized in our quarterly awards for the first time ever,[],r/sysadmin,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gf9rb0,False,dark,0.97,,public,1369,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1369,,True,self,False,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1588897595.0,text,6,,,text,self.sysadmin,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every quarter, our company holds an Awards &amp;quot;ceremony&amp;quot; - just a section towards the end of our Town Hall.

,sysadmin,"Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins. Ie. Working on a ticket then logging how much time you spent actively working on it. And being expected to account for your full 8 hour day.


More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized. I'm mainly trying to decide if it's something I just accept and fudge the numbers like im told is common practice (track 30 min blocks of time and just split up the 8 hours however you feel on whichever tickets you worked on), or if maybe it's time to update my resume as it's as uncommon as I think, a sign of distrust and potentially worse things to come.",t2_14pzkx,False,,0,False,Is Sysadmin time tracking a thing?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/sysadmin,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gfqrhd,False,light,0.82,,public,20,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,20,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588962742.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.sysadmin,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins.

,sysadmin,"We are currently migrating our DHCP scopes and DNS zones into Infoblox. We have 100s of scopes, most are in Infoblox now, but a few left on Windows DHCP still for various reason.

We are about to migrate our Internal AD zone ""[mycompany.com](https://mycompany.com)"" to Infoblox. Will Windows DHCP serving leases in ""[mycompany.com](https://mycompany.com)"" be able to dynamically update records in the zone once it is de-coupled from the domain controller and in Infoblox?

Infoblox is already allowing the dynamic updates, and we have tested it well with Infoblox DHCP scopes and Windows servers being able to successfully update records directly towards the new SOA (Infoblox) for other zones we have migrated.

,sysadmin,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

,sysadmin,"TL;DR

What is planning? Firewall licenses expired, new firewall quickly installed, but not fully configured. Need both running at the same time, on same subnet. Currently cannot connect to any devices pointing to the new gateway when logged into VPN, but can still access devices with the old gateway still statically assigned.

Hey all - been pulling my hair out all day, hoping to get some advice to what I'm overlooking here.

Scenario: SonicWall FireWall is getting replaced by Cisco Meraki FireWall. We were not ready to do the switchover, but licensing expired. We have set up DHCP to point to our Meraki as the Gateway to ensure we're using the licensed content filtering, as our SonicWall CFS expired.

Everything inside our network seems to be fine - users still have internet access, and the content filtering is working.

The problem comes that we're still using our NetExtender VPN licenses, as we haven't done the configuration to get the Cisco Meraki VPN set up with our Active Directory.


The issue we're having is that after the gateway changed in our DHCP and our workstations got the updated gateway, some of our remote users who were using the NetExtender VPN + RDP to get to their desktop are now unable to get to their workstation when the gateway is set to our Cisco Meraki gateway.


Does anyone know what settings I need to adjust to make sure that our NetExtender SSL VPN is able to connect to these machines?

    Gateway 1: 192.168.1.1 -&gt; Points to Fiber Connection
    Gateway 2: 192.168.1.2 -&gt; Points to COAX Connection

The above is an example of the two gateways - not my actual IP addressing. They're on the same subnet, I need to maintain both of them temporarily, as I have a Site-to-Site VPN to an offsite Data Center that I can't break until we pull backups from the DataCenter (previous MSP is still hosting some servers for us - we're working on getting away from them)


Any help would be appreciated - I'm not well versed in networking, and basically learn as I go, but this has me stumped. 

Right now we're having these users connect to our terminal server that we maintain for emergency access, but we have limited seats at the moment due to budget reasons.

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

,sysadmin,"Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins. Ie. Working on a ticket then logging how much time you spent actively working on it. And being expected to account for your full 8 hour day.


More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized. I'm mainly trying to decide if it's something I just accept and fudge the numbers like im told is common practice (track 30 min blocks of time and just split up the 8 hours however you feel on whichever tickets you worked on), or if maybe it's time to update my resume as it's as uncommon as I think, a sign of distrust and potentially worse things to come.",t2_14pzkx,False,,0,False,Is Sysadmin time tracking a thing?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/sysadmin,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gfqrhd,False,light,0.82,,public,20,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,20,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588962742.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.sysadmin,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins.

,sysadmin,"We are currently migrating our DHCP scopes and DNS zones into Infoblox. We have 100s of scopes, most are in Infoblox now, but a few left on Windows DHCP still for various reason.

We are about to migrate our Internal AD zone ""[mycompany.com](https://mycompany.com)"" to Infoblox. Will Windows DHCP serving leases in ""[mycompany.com](https://mycompany.com)"" be able to dynamically update records in the zone once it is de-coupled from the domain controller and in Infoblox?

Infoblox is already allowing the dynamic updates, and we have tested it well with Infoblox DHCP scopes and Windows servers being able to successfully update records directly towards the new SOA (Infoblox) for other zones we have migrated.

,sysadmin,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

,sysadmin,"TL;DR

What is planning? Firewall licenses expired, new firewall quickly installed, but not fully configured. Need both running at the same time, on same subnet. Currently cannot connect to any devices pointing to the new gateway when logged into VPN, but can still access devices with the old gateway still statically assigned.

Hey all - been pulling my hair out all day, hoping to get some advice to what I'm overlooking here.

Scenario: SonicWall FireWall is getting replaced by Cisco Meraki FireWall. We were not ready to do the switchover, but licensing expired. We have set up DHCP to point to our Meraki as the Gateway to ensure we're using the licensed content filtering, as our SonicWall CFS expired.

Everything inside our network seems to be fine - users still have internet access, and the content filtering is working.

The problem comes that we're still using our NetExtender VPN licenses, as we haven't done the configuration to get the Cisco Meraki VPN set up with our Active Directory.


The issue we're having is that after the gateway changed in our DHCP and our workstations got the updated gateway, some of our remote users who were using the NetExtender VPN + RDP to get to their desktop are now unable to get to their workstation when the gateway is set to our Cisco Meraki gateway.


Does anyone know what settings I need to adjust to make sure that our NetExtender SSL VPN is able to connect to these machines?

    Gateway 1: 192.168.1.1 -&gt; Points to Fiber Connection
    Gateway 2: 192.168.1.2 -&gt; Points to COAX Connection

The above is an example of the two gateways - not my actual IP addressing. They're on the same subnet, I need to maintain both of them temporarily, as I have a Site-to-Site VPN to an offsite Data Center that I can't break until we pull backups from the DataCenter (previous MSP is still hosting some servers for us - we're working on getting away from them)


Any help would be appreciated - I'm not well versed in networking, and basically learn as I go, but this has me stumped.

&lt;p&gt;What is planning? Firewall licenses expired, new firewall quickly installed, but not fully configured. Need both running at the same time, on same subnet. Currently cannot connect to any devices pointing to the new gateway when logged into VPN, but can still access devices with the old gateway still statically assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey all - been pulling my hair out all day, hoping to get some advice to what I&amp;#39;m overlooking here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario: SonicWall FireWall is getting replaced by Cisco Meraki FireWall. We were not ready to do the switchover, but licensing expired. We have set up DHCP to point to our Meraki as the Gateway to ensure we&amp;#39;re using the licensed content filtering, as our SonicWall CFS expired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything inside our network seems to be fine - users still have internet access, and the content filtering is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem comes that we&amp;#39;re still using our NetExtender VPN licenses, as we haven&amp;#39;t done the configuration to get the Cisco Meraki VPN set up with our Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue we&amp;#39;re having is that after the gateway changed in our DHCP and our workstations got the updated gateway, some of our remote users who were using the NetExtender VPN + RDP to get to their desktop are now unable to get to their workstation when the gateway is set to our Cisco Meraki gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what settings I need to adjust to make sure that our NetExtender SSL VPN is able to connect to these machines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Gateway 1: 192.168.1.1 -&amp;gt; Points to Fiber Connection
Gateway 2: 192.168.1.2 -&amp;gt; Points to COAX Connection
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is an example of the two gateways - not my actual IP addressing. They&amp;#39;re on the same subnet, I need to maintain both of them temporarily, as I have a Site-to-Site VPN to an offsite Data Center that I can&amp;#39;t break until we pull backups from the DataCenter (previous MSP is still hosting some servers for us - we&amp;#39;re working on getting away from them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated - I&amp;#39;m not well versed in networking, and basically learn as I go, but this has me stumped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we&amp;#39;re having these users connect to our terminal server that we maintain for emergency access, but we have limited seats at the moment due to budget reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, if anyone can help me out of this blunder of piss-poor project management, I would greatly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

,sysadmin,"Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins. Ie. Working on a ticket then logging how much time you spent actively working on it. And being expected to account for your full 8 hour day.


More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized. I'm mainly trying to decide if it's something I just accept and fudge the numbers like im told is common practice (track 30 min blocks of time and just split up the 8 hours however you feel on whichever tickets you worked on), or if maybe it's time to update my resume as it's as uncommon as I think, a sign of distrust and potentially worse things to come.",t2_14pzkx,False,,0,False,Is Sysadmin time tracking a thing?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/sysadmin,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gfqrhd,False,light,0.82,,public,21,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,21,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588962742.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.sysadmin,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins.

,sysadmin,"We are currently migrating our DHCP scopes and DNS zones into Infoblox. We have 100s of scopes, most are in Infoblox now, but a few left on Windows DHCP still for various reason.

We are about to migrate our Internal AD zone ""[mycompany.com](https://mycompany.com)"" to Infoblox. Will Windows DHCP serving leases in ""[mycompany.com](https://mycompany.com)"" be able to dynamically update records in the zone once it is de-coupled from the domain controller and in Infoblox?

,sysadmin,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

Without client flag set:

      PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; w32tm /query /status
      Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
      Stratum: 1 (primary reference - syncd by radio clock)

&lt;p&gt;Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I&amp;#39;ve stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  c:\windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /resync
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a message from windows saying &lt;code&gt;The computer did not resync because no time data was available.&lt;/code&gt; I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses &amp;quot;symmetric active&amp;quot; mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use &amp;quot;client mode&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically listed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn&amp;#39;t interpret the response properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in &amp;quot;client mode&amp;quot; you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to &lt;a href=""/u/DanHalen_phd""&gt;/u/DanHalen_phd&lt;/a&gt; ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without client flag set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  PS C:\Windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /query /status
  Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
  Stratum: 1 (primary reference - syncd by radio clock)
  Precision: -6 (15.625ms per tick)
  Root Delay: 0.0000000s
  Root Dispersion: 10.0000000s
  ReferenceId: 0x4C4F434C (source name:  &amp;quot;LOCL&amp;quot;)
  Last Successful Sync Time: 5/8/2020 8:35:12 AM
  Source: Local CMOS Clock
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  PS C:\Windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /resync
  Sending resync command to local computer
  The computer did not resync because no time data was available.
  Poll Interval: 6 (64s)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With client flag set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  PS C:\Windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /query /status
  Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
  Stratum: 4 (secondary reference - syncd by (S)NTP)

  Last Successful Sync Time: 5/8/2020 9:13:48 AM
  Source: 192.168.32.1,0x08
  Poll Interval: 8 (256s)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  PS C:\Windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /resync
  Sending resync command to local computer
  The command completed successfully.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So issue is resolved. Hopefully someone else finds this useful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

\-----

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

We're still a long way off where we need to be, but at least now we know for sure that we're going in the right direction.",t2_zti1a,False,,1,False,IT got recognized in our quarterly awards for the first time ever,[],r/sysadmin,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gf9rb0,False,dark,0.97,,public,1363,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1363,,True,self,False,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1588897595.0,text,6,,,text,self.sysadmin,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every quarter, our company holds an Awards &amp;quot;ceremony&amp;quot; - just a section towards the end of our Town Hall.

,sysadmin,"Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins. Ie. Working on a ticket then logging how much time you spent actively working on it. And being expected to account for your full 8 hour day.


More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized. I'm mainly trying to decide if it's something I just accept and fudge the numbers like im told is common practice (track 30 min blocks of time and just split up the 8 hours however you feel on whichever tickets you worked on), or if maybe it's time to update my resume as it's as uncommon as I think, a sign of distrust and potentially worse things to come.",t2_14pzkx,False,,0,False,Is Sysadmin time tracking a thing?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/sysadmin,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gfqrhd,False,light,0.79,,public,19,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,19,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588962742.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.sysadmin,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins.

,sysadmin,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

Without client flag set:

      PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; w32tm /query /status
      Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
      Stratum: 1 (primary reference - syncd by radio clock)
      Precision: -6 (15.625ms per tick)

      Root Dispersion: 10.0000000s

      Last Successful Sync Time: 5/8/2020 8:35:12 AM
      Source: Local CMOS Clock

And:

      PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync
      Sending resync command to local computer
      The computer did not resync because no time data was available.
      Poll Interval: 6 (64s)


With client flag set:

      PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; w32tm /query /status
      Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
      Stratum: 4 (secondary reference - syncd by (S)NTP)

      ReferenceId: 0x0AF82001 (source IP:  192.168.32.1)
      Last Successful Sync Time: 5/8/2020 9:13:48 AM
      Source: 192.168.32.1,0x08
      Poll Interval: 8 (256s)

And:

      PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync
      Sending resync command to local computer

I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I&amp;#39;ve stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  c:\windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /resync
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a message from windows saying &lt;code&gt;The computer did not resync because no time data was available.&lt;/code&gt; I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses &amp;quot;symmetric active&amp;quot; mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use &amp;quot;client mode&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically listed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn&amp;#39;t interpret the response properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in &amp;quot;client mode&amp;quot; you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to &lt;a href=""/u/DanHalen_phd""&gt;/u/DanHalen_phd&lt;/a&gt; ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without client flag set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  PS C:\Windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /query /status
  Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
  Stratum: 1 (primary reference - syncd by radio clock)

  Last Successful Sync Time: 5/8/2020 8:35:12 AM
  Source: Local CMOS Clock
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  PS C:\Windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /resync
  Sending resync command to local computer
  The computer did not resync because no time data was available.
  Poll Interval: 6 (64s)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

2. All systems in all three tiers need to be members of the same domain to permit utilization of domain resources.

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS currently.  This is a test virtual server.

I am trying to use realmd to connect to Active Directory and I am successfully joining but running into issues which seem to be related to group enumeration ( and as a result, authentication issues for users trying to connect via SSH, I will explain)..

Here is the method I used to join the domain (subbing out the actual domain name for 'domain'):

    yum install -y realmd 
    yum upgrade -y
    realm discover domain.local
    yum install -y &lt;packagename&gt;....   # after running realm discover it will display necessary package dependencies, I've installed them all.
    sudo apt install packagekit
    
    realm join --user=domain_admin --computer-ou='&lt;Valid OU for computer object&gt;' --os-name='Ubuntu' DOMAIN.LOCAL
    
    reboot
    
    vi /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
      -  I set 'use_fully_qualified_names = false'
      -  I set 'fallback_homedir = /home/DOMAIN/%u'
    systemctl restart sssd

The domain has an AD security group, ""srv-servername-ssh"" and if you are a part of that AD security group, you are permitted to log in via SSH.   I use sshd\_config on my servers to specify (via AllowGroups) certain AD groups which are permitted to SSH to the box.   This works, as long as the system realizes the user trying to log in is part of a valid group.

My issue is: in most cases, if I try to perform this command..

    id user1

..it recognizes the AD user, but returns only a few groups (usually only returns 'domain users' group, very rarely returns the membership list).

If I try typing the following, I can see the full group membership:

    getent group srv-servername-ssh

I am lost on why this is happening, but it is preventing reliable SSH login for the domain users who are supposed to be able to , since the server usually doesn't recognize the user as being part of a valid (allowed) group for SSH access.  Any idea?

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

We're still a long way off where we need to be, but at least now we know for sure that we're going in the right direction.",t2_zti1a,False,,1,False,IT got recognized in our quarterly awards for the first time ever,[],r/sysadmin,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gf9rb0,False,dark,0.97,,public,1367,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1367,,True,self,False,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1588897595.0,text,6,,,text,self.sysadmin,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every quarter, our company holds an Awards &amp;quot;ceremony&amp;quot; - just a section towards the end of our Town Hall.

&lt;p&gt;I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time I&amp;#39;d already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft&amp;#39;s SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).&lt;br/&gt;
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we&amp;#39;re up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp;amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can now just &lt;strong&gt;get the job done&lt;/strong&gt; without worrying about tools that aren&amp;#39;t fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; go wrong, we&amp;#39;ll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re still a long way off where we need to be, but at least now we know for sure that we&amp;#39;re going in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized.

I've checked the event logs on these systems and am not seeing any hints except for unexpected shutdowns when the user hard reset the computer.

,sysadmin,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

Without client flag set:

      PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; w32tm /query /status

I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I&amp;#39;ve stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  c:\windows\system32&amp;gt; w32tm /resync
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a message from windows saying &lt;code&gt;The computer did not resync because no time data was available.&lt;/code&gt; I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses &amp;quot;symmetric active&amp;quot; mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use &amp;quot;client mode&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically listed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn&amp;#39;t interpret the response properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in &amp;quot;client mode&amp;quot; you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to &lt;a href=""/u/DanHalen_phd""&gt;/u/DanHalen_phd&lt;/a&gt; ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without client flag set:&lt;/p&gt;

,sysadmin,"Hi all, hopefully someone can help me, I've been trying to resolve this on my own but, no dice..

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS currently.  This is a test virtual server.

I am trying to use realmd to connect to Active Directory and I am successfully joining but running into issues which seem to be related to group enumeration ( and as a result, authentication issues for users trying to connect via SSH, I will explain)..

Here is the method I used to join the domain (subbing out the actual domain name for 'domain'):

    yum install -y realmd 
    yum upgrade -y
    realm discover domain.local
    yum install -y &lt;packagename&gt;....   # after running realm discover it will display necessary package dependencies, I've installed them all.
    sudo apt install packagekit
    
    realm join --user=domain_admin --computer-ou='&lt;Valid OU for computer object&gt;' --os-name='Ubuntu' DOMAIN.LOCAL
    
    reboot
    
    vi /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
      -  I set 'use_fully_qualified_names = false'
      -  I set 'fallback_homedir = /home/DOMAIN/%u'
    systemctl restart sssd

The domain has an AD security group, ""srv-servername-ssh"" and if you are a part of that AD security group, you are permitted to log in via SSH.   I use sshd\_config on my servers to specify (via AllowGroups) certain AD groups which are permitted to SSH to the box.   This works, as long as the system realizes the user trying to log in is part of a valid group.

My issue is: in most cases, if I try to perform this command..

    id user1

..it recognizes the AD user, but returns only a few groups (usually only returns 'domain users' group, very rarely returns the membership list).

If I try typing the following, I can see the full group membership:

    getent group srv-servername-ssh

I am lost on why this is happening, but it is preventing reliable SSH login for the domain users who are supposed to be able to , since the server usually doesn't recognize the user as being part of a valid (allowed) group for SSH access.  Any idea?

&lt;p&gt;..it recognizes the AD user, but returns only a few groups (usually only returns &amp;#39;domain users&amp;#39; group, very rarely returns the membership list).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try typing the following, I can see the full group membership:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;getent group srv-servername-ssh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am lost on why this is happening, but it is preventing reliable SSH login for the domain users who are supposed to be able to , since the server usually doesn&amp;#39;t recognize the user as being part of a valid (allowed) group for SSH access.  Any idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the details if I try typing &amp;#39;realm list&amp;#39;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Domain.local
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: Domain.LOCAL
