2,t3_gjdubc,"I could use a brain check/fresh minds on this.  Any Cisco gurus up tonight?

I've got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.  

I've built a bunch of tunnels Cisco &gt; Sonicwall where both sides have public IPs.  So many that it's beyond routine - I have a template.  The problem I'm having is with the Cisco initiating.  

My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it's just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it's simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I'm stumped.  

I have my ACL, transform-set, crypto-map, NAT exclusion - I think everything is there.  I can ping the SW's WAN from the Cisco CLI.  PCAP in the SW doesn't show any attempts to even start phase 1.

The router is first connected to a seperate router (I believe an Arris model, lost my note), then a switch and our Point of Sale stations and printers, all by ethernet.

Secondly, the Comcast router is connected to a Luxul Switch, which is then connected to 3 PoE injectors, and then 3 Luxul APs. 2 are for our guest WiFi network, and 1 for Office/Administrative network.

Lastly, the comcast router is connected to a DVR for our multiple coaxial cameras.

We have been experiencing some intermittent issues with our internet connectivity over our wireless network. The wireless signal itself is pretty consistent and strong, but some devices connected are often unable to connect to the internet or appear to be connected but recieve DNS errors or are just unable to do anyhting online.

I was wondering if anybody has experience in configuring DHCP server in RHEL 7 or upwards. We will be provided with a RHEL or CentOS OS (version 7 probably) to configure as a central or global DHCP server for many subnets connected to the central DHCP server by third party transport network. Each subnet's gateway will be configured with DHCP Relay. I included a [picture](https://imgur.com/PcrFTt1) detailing the situation if it helps.

You can clearly see the DHCP clients are not residing in the server's subnet (that's why the DHCP relays). But RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 dictates that DHCP server will only provide or feed dynamic IP address to the subnet in it's own interface. Basically, it will look at it's own interface's IP configuration and feed IP to that subnet, if I am understand correctly. RHEL 6 had provision for configuring which interface it'll listen to in /etc/sysconfig/dhcpd file but that file is deprecated in RHEL 7 or more.

**So any idea how can we feed IP address from DHCP server to a client not in the local broadcast domain of the DHCP server?**

In terms of the image I provided, the DHCP server have only one interface to listen to ([10.21.125.60](https://10.21.125.60) /24). And it has to feed an IP address to a client is subnet #1 . So what do we need to do in dhcpd.conf file?

i'm looking for a new Hardware vendor for a specific purpose.

We are going to integrate a new Layer2 circuit provider that will deliver Layer2 transport services  up to 900 MBit/s on a 10G E-NNI Link. These virtual EPL Circuits allow a maximum burst (Bc) of 12,5 kBytes (MEF recommendation) , independent of the bandwidth.

Unfortunately i can't use our Juniper MX boxes to produce internet services based on this new Layer2 services because the minimum burst that the MX can deliver is a Tc of about 1,69ms which completely saturates the WAN circuit and is leading to excessive drops and a very bad TCP performance.

So i'm looking for an alternative edge router for this use case. 

The first (and most direct) idea is to switch to Cisco ASR1000 that has a quite powerful shaper performance and is able to produce a nearly zero-burst CIR.

The master agent route reduces our financial exposure but I'm not the most excited about introducing another party into the mix with our customer, the ISP and ourselves.

Has anyone made this decision before and have some feedback to share? Any veterans of the telco channel or agent game care to chime in?

One of the questions we've been trying to understand is if being successful as a subagent and driving a good volume of contracts will help help us get access to some of the better wholesale programs in the future if we decided switch to wholesale.",Selling Internet Access Wholesale vs through Master Agent,r/networking,0.71,8,1589359808.0,,,11

I am having a weird issue that i am trying to fix for a couple of days.

Here goes:

37,t3_gieb79,"On j-net forums there are unresolved topics both old from 2016 and new from last month about the newer jdhcp daemon config not supporting dhcp attribute settings in static bindings. For example, you can not tell a specific host to use a specific boot server or a different name-server, etc..  Only the host name and IP can be specified for a specific host. You can only specify other dhcp attributes for the entire pool.

That seems like a core feature of a dhcp server and I am trying to figure out what to make of it not being addressed by juniper in over 4 years.

In general, neither SRX dhcp implementation seems very complete and issues brought up on j-net are not addressed by juniper. The operational commands to monitor the leases/bindings are not very robust. You can not tell if a lease is a associated with a static binding. The newer jdhcp daemon does not support listing the static bindings at all until a client obtains a lease against it!

Do you think that most people that use SRX as a gateway use something else as the DHCP server?  I am going against the grain by expecting an SRX to be a good DHCP server?

Its a very simple unit, its connected via RJ11 (in the terminal) to RJ45 into a switch, all it needs to work is internet, simple enough. Its configured with static IP (DHCP does not make it establish a link)

The problem is that its randomly stops working, and the issue is that the link to the switch goes down, i can move the terminal to ANY other port and nothing happens, if i plug in a PC in the same port it works instantly. Its almost as if the MAC is banned or something, but the switch is a very old HP and have no such feature that i know of. 

Ive tried turning off STP and all other features on one port but i cant get it to establish a link, there is nothing in the logs (Because the switch is so old) that says anything about the port. Now for something even more weird, we get a new payment terminal sent to us because the old one wont establish a link to the switch, connect the new one and it works instantly (Probably because it has a new MAC), all is good for about a month and it stops working again.

I take the payment terminal, plug it into our switch at the office and it works instantly, take it back to the customer and it wont establish a link.

44,t3_gi4aug,"My understanding of MPLS LDP is that it allocates a label per destination prefix in the FIB. So, If I advertise the global internet table between routers connecting over LDP enabled interfaces, will I exceed a label limit or set fire to my router?

Some context;
I have several routers iBGP peering with each other, enabled for the IPv4 and VPNv4 address families.
The global table on these routers connects to the internet, learns a default route which is redistributed, all happy.
There are several MPLS VRFs, VPNv4 routes being exchanged successfully, also happy.
Several (virtual) devices act as gateways to their respective MPLS networks, eBGP peering with both their VRF and the global table - no issues.

Now rather than just a default route, I need to start ingesting the full internet table and redistributing it into my iBGP.
My concern is that my router will try to allocate a label for every single global destination prefix, and exceed some capacity. I'm doing some reading on LDP merging but it sounds like it's only relevant for P routers.

So what's the solution? And if any of my understanding is incorrect please let me know.
- Run MPLS VPNs and Internet tables on different hardware?
- Different iBGP peering(s) for IPv4 and VPNv4, and keep IPv4 off LDP interfaces? 
- Run the internet table in it's own VRF so there are many fewer outer MPLS labels? Not even sure if this would work because there's still the inner label?

I have inherited a small network in an office building which provides an internet connection for a Mitel PBX and a handful of Mitel VOIP phones. This network used to have a household Netgear router at its core and I have now upgraded to a Netgate SG-5100 running pfSense.

The issue I'm struggling with is that due to people working remotely we have the need for a few of these Mitel phones to work from the users' homes. This was functioning fine using the Netgear router configured by the previous IT admins but I'm having trouble with TFTP and pfSense.

I have gone as far as configuring a 1 to 1 NAT from a public IP to the PBX and allowing any and all traffic but the phones still fail to provision via TFTP. I have also enabled the ""TFTP Proxy"" available in pfSense on all cominations of the interfaces but I still cant get it to work.

If anyone has any ideas I would really appreciate the input.

Thanks.

EDIT: NOW RESOLVED. pfSense works fine. Don't blindly trust information from vendors.

So I braved Covid-19 and went on site to troubleshoot in person today. Long story short, I am guilty of the first sin of IT and I did not verify the information given to me by the VOIP vendor... I assumed that he knew what the IP of his own TFTP server was. So now that I figured out for them what the correct IP is and adjusted the NAT accordingly the phones provision just fine.

We had a small issue of one way audio after that but I just had to add an outbound NAT mapping with static port set so that pfSense would not rewrite the source port of the outbound PBX traffic. That and making sure the phone was set to ""NAT"" mode instead of ""native"" in the PBX.

to begin with: I originally posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/gfeiae/expanding_to_a_new_site_with_their_own_second/) in r/HomeNetworking but didn't get a single reply. I guess this was too advanced for them. I'm usually the guy that answers posts there but this is even for me too new.

# Short version:

I currently have 3 sites (connected via NanoStations), one EdgeRouter 4, and a bunch of VLANS. This ER4 is the single point for inter-VLAN-routing and internet access. I want to connect another Family and their business to our network so we can share internal traffic but their private/business traffic uses their ISP and not ours.

# Miscellaneous:

I have a good knowledge about VLAN and firewall rules but only basic knowledge about NAT rules and no L3 and static routing knowledge. I fear that I need to use the latter for this project though. I am an IT-Student and worked a little bit as a 2nd level support for MS networks but got laid off until covid disappears. I have very good computer knowledge and networking is my hobby. My ""home lab"" is my running config though so I can only do stuff in the night but I'm kinda nocturnal anyway.

(just to be clear, we're the same family, but operate different businesses. We get along but don't want to share everything)I belong to Family 1, so if you find words like ""us, me, our"" then they refer to Family 1.""their"" is Family 2.

# Long Version:

Here's a simplified network diagram of the network: [https://imgur.com/a/rkgwr2a](https://imgur.com/a/rkgwr2a)There's also a description on the picture which I have written before I wrote this post. Some information may be new but I try to include everything in more details here. The diagram does not depict every single device. Only network devices and important ones for this project.

# Current Situation:

* All Sites but ""E"" are connected as depicted.
* Everything runs over the EdgeRouter 4 on ""Site A"". ""Site D"" is owned by ""Family 2"" but uses our internet because they're right next to our property (""Site B"") and don't need much bandwidth.
* ""Family 2"" also owns ""Site E"", which is a restaurant.
* The links always carry all VLANS because we have 9 different SSIDs for the VLANS (except for ""VLAN 60"" which is wired only) and all APs broadcast them.
* Network equipment is on ""VLAN 10"". I see it as a ""management"" VLAN. My devices are on ""VLAN 50"" and firewall rules allows them to access ""VLAN 10"".

# Additional info:

* Family 1 has static IP addresses.
* Family 2 currently does not.
* Family 1 has 80 down, 15 up.
* Family 2 currently has 25 down, 10 up (but it varies a lot).

# The Hardware:

* An EdgeRouter 4 is used as the router.
* The switches are currently from different vendors. I'm planning on buying some EdgeSwitches for better integration with UNMS. (As soon as I gather 10 devices for their hosted service)The one at ""Site B"" will most likely be replaced with one as we need a new switch for expanding ""Site B"" anyway and then we'll move the current Zyxel Switch one link downwards to the new building. I'm not certain whether it needs L3 features (EdgeSwitch 8). You guys tell me please!
* The Access Points are tp-link EAPs. The management controller is located at Site A.
* All the network equipment at ""Site E"" does not exist yet. They currently run on the ISP Modem/Wireless-Router Combo and a dumb switch for the cash register.

# The goals:

* ""Site E"" still has all VLANS from Family 1 so Employees and us can roam around BUT traffic from ""Family 2"" VLANS (which do not exist yet) should use their ISP, including VLAN 70.Optionally: All traffic happening on their site goes through their ISP.
* ""Site E"" needs to operate even if the Link to ""Site B"" drops.(This might be an issue if they use the Pi-hole on ""VLAN 10"". I'm not certain what happens to the access points if they lose connection to the controller. I believe they would still work though.)If the link is down, the VLANS from Family 1 may go down as well. Ideally they'd use the Family 2 ISP, but not required. Guests however should stay online and I strongly believe that they require access to the EAP management controller for the captive portal. That might need a site-2-site VPN connection incase the link fails. (I hope that the link is stable though, so just keep it in mind, but don't see it as a requirement just yet)
* There's a guest network on all sites. As the sites are all on the same street, guests should be able to roam around between the sites. Almost the whole street is covered by our access points. Traffic happening at Site.
* I, on ""Site A"" and ""VLAN 50"", need to be able to manage the whole network and access all devices.

55,t3_ghqcoj,"Hello,  


We've been using NPS (2x NPS servers with Aruba IAPs) with machine authentication for a while now without any issue. We've just received a new batch of devices (laptops, tablets) and after deployment, we realized they do not want to connect to our secure network. Everything on the clients seems fine, they have a computer certificate, are domain-joined and get the policies from GPO. At first, I thought it was an issue with those new devices, but after wiping my own (old batch) PC to test, it doesn't work either. So I thought it might've been something with our OS deployment, but today I wiped another old computer and this one works with our secure wireless network. This working computer has the exact same drivers as my personal computer (which doesn't work). It seems to me ""Machine authentication"" is not working with those devices as I get a prompt for username/password. I am at a complete loss as to what causes this and need to fix it before the lockdown is lifted or else things are not looking good.  


On the NPS server logs, nothing seems out of place. When a computer authenticates, it shows the computer account object as a ""user"". When I try to use a computer that doesn't work, it just prompts me for user/password and that fails as we use machine auth. I don't know why it's not forcing trying machine auth. The NPS server certificate is valid. Certificate stores for a working vs non-working machines are identical.

SOLUTION:
With Credential Guard, it seems like some auths won't work. We were using PEAP-MSCHAPV2. (See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-considerations)

Wi-fi and VPN Considerations

When you enable Windows Defender Credential Guard, you can no longer use NTLM classic authentication for Single Sign-On. You will be forced to enter your credentials to use these protocols and cannot save the credentials for future use. If you are using WiFi and VPN endpoints that are based on MS-CHAPv2, they are subject to similar attacks as for NTLMv1. For WiFi and VPN connections, Microsoft recommends that organizations move from MSCHAPv2-based connections such as PEAP-MSCHAPv2 and EAP-MSCHAPv2, to certificate-based authentication such as PEAP-TLS or EAP-TLS.

Even if I applied what was suggested online to mitigate this without affecting current users, it did not work. I changed the NPS policies to only use Certificate auth and the 802.1X GPO to EAP-TTLS. All clients can now connect but those who had the old policy will have to be gpupdate'd some way, or I'll have to push something from Intune.",Issue with NPS not authenticating some Windows clients,r/networking,0.72,6,1589241805.0,,,9

60,t3_ghmcwp,"Hi all,

I have a weird issue. I recently replaced an old Draytek router with a Juniper SRX100B.

The network is pretty simple, there are two VLANS connected to the firewall with just a small handful of servers connected. There is also a site-to-site VPN connected to a data centre.

Site-to-site VPN seems to work fine, I have Exchange replication between them and this is working fine.

The issue i've got, is that internet access from servers on the VLANS connected to the Juniper are very very slow and in most cases anything TCP just doesn't work.

So, from the servers I can steadily ping [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and not drop a single packet. If I try to go on a website, 90% of the time it will take forever to load or just completely fail. An apt-get update from an Ubuntu server also fails. 

DNS resolution looks to be working fine, for some reason it seems anything TCP out to the WAN just doesn't wanna work.

The config on the Juniper is pretty basic really, there is an outbound firewall rule allowing anything from trust (the VLANS) to untrust (The WAN)

I've checked CPU/memory on the Juniper and all looks to be good.

We use their access points/switches (never routers/firewalls) and the camera gear. The fact that their cameras included ""free"" NVR and the networking gear included a ""free"" controller was a nice touch. 

But as with all things, it appears when it is ""free"", you are the product.

The last few firmware/controller releases, UBNT has been collecting telemetry, first starting without making it obvious to us that they were doing so. It was an opt-out rather than an opt-in. The most recent release, they've begun collecting even more data and making it very hard to stop it. My concern is even if I stop it, there is nothing stopping them from pushing out another update that collects more data.

89,t3_gftmhz,"Hello,

First, I'm so sorry for some stupid questions I may ask. I'm doing my best at my level of knowledge.

I'm working for a year now in a high school, and we plan to change our network infrastructure. From the opening 20 years ago (that was a small high school at that time), it has been a flat network. It is now fragmented into VLANs (into the same network, yes), and thanks to Huawei hybrid vlan, we can say ""that vlan can communicate with that vlan, but not with that vlan,  even if they both are in the same network"". But it's a ""all or nothing"", of course as it's layer 2 we cannot filter on ports.

This brings us great performances as it's a full layer 2 ""network"", BUT it's a bad security option, and it's quite horrible to manage.

I would like to transform this in order to have a more standard topology, easier to understand, to manage and with as good performances. Here is what we have in terms of needs:

* 2500 students
* 20 classrooms with around 40 computers per room, those classrooms are in 3 buildings (8 - 8 - 4) within 5000m²
* 50TB iSCSI shared by multiple active directories (SMB, complex NTFS rights) to those 800 computers
* This 50TB SMB share is also shared by SFTP on the internet through another dedicated server
* There is multiple licences servers
* We need a great bandwidth between those 50TB share and computers, big amounts of data are transferred as it's mainly 3D projects,...
* There are also multiple (around 20) web servers/dbs for high school services
* Computers within a classroom can communicate together, but can't communicate with other classrooms

&amp;#x200B;

I already checked the most popular options for big networks:

* 3-tier topology: I've got shared feelings because of this:
   * Aggregation layer, that is meant to route trafic beneath the aggregation switch L3 wouldn't route anything as there is anything to route between classrooms
   * I don't know where I should put servers:
      * 50TB Share at core layer for better performances? But It may be better to evitate coming to the core to access a file share? So not the ideal topology for our use case?
      * Should the other servers be under a distribution switch?
* Spine-leaves: Seems too complex and not suitable for our use case (also very expensive)
   * I guess we can have something easier for such an easy use case: 800 computers must access to one share with great performances, to internet and to multiple licences servers.

We also had a question about DMZ: In our case, the SFTP server that shares to the internet our 50TB iscsi should definitely be in the DMZ. But this SFTP server is linked to a SMB share, which is shared by a DC, which is linked to the iSCSI. Should that DC be in the DMZ? That would make no sense to put a DC inside a DMZ, but then I don't see how to publish on this share on the internet without having such a security issue.

And we foresee that it could become ""normal"" down the road so we wanna a better protection.

I never did that before and Google search brings me a lot of info. Look like MS doesn't have one native come with RRAS. I saw few 3rd party options like Duo, or SAASPASS. But I have zero experience so I am looking for some. Hopefully, it would be just like FB, whenever the RRAS detects a login from a new IP, it sends out a txt, or email, or asking for the 6-digit code like Reddit does.

104,t3_gf6w1h,"Cisco Firepower 2130 w/ASA code and Microsoft Windows 10 VPN client (Always On) using IKEv2 w/AES-128 with Machine certificate authentication.  

Draft: #1

Hopefully this will help out anyone trying to get MS Windows 10 (always on) VPN working with ASA.  I was having some issues online trying to find out more information on how to set this up.  I got it working in my environment so figured I would try to share something I learned.  

&amp;#x200B;

But Motavar why? Questions:  

\- Why Cisco ASA and not a MS VPN /RAS box.  Unfortunately spinning up another set of VPN services results in additional systems to support. From servers, to network route changes, firewall changes,  to border security, to ownership, documentation, everything.  Sometimes it may be easier to point new VPN clients to an existing VPN headend (Cisco ASA) which is already setup. 

\- Why MS VPN Client.  ""Some People"" wanted to move to Always on VPN over AnyConnect. Not my call..

&amp;#x200B;

Please Note:

\- This documentation assumes your Cisco Firepower 2130 ASA is running 9.13.x code to support Appliance mode. I'm not going to go into details on how to do this.. 

\- We are also assuming that under your ""AnyConnect Connection Profiles"" section you enabled ""Allow user to select connection profile on the login page"" is checked and you're using a custom connection profile for AnyConnect users. 

NOTE: This is important since a custom profile for AnyConnect will make sure your users are not using the ""DefaultRAGroup"" for connetions.

NOTE2: 3rd party VPN clients such as the MS Windows 10 VPN client will be using the ""DefaultRAGroup"" for the connection. You have to make sure no other IPSec/AnyConnect clients will be connecting to this group.  We are going to modify this for MS clients use only.

\- We are assuming you rolled out Machine certs from a local CA. Also make sure your machine certs have a subject name field or else the connection will fail as the ASA uses the SN for tracking who connected.  Without a Subject field you won't be able to connect. 

\- We are assuming you are using MS VPN Client for Windows 10 that supports IKEv2 w/PFS 

\- We are assuming most work is done in ASDM

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lets Begin!

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: Some timers/settings may vary on your particular setup. So make changes as needed for your org. This is only a helpful framework to get you closer to getting your MS clients to connect.  You know your environment so the changes you make and what you break... is on YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Create a Group Policy:

\------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Group Policies""

&amp;#x200B;

\* In this example we are creating a Group Policy called ""AOVPN"" for Always On VPN.

So create group policy ""AOVPN"".

Inside of the policy setup set your max connection time to ""unlimited"" and Idle timeout to ""30 Minutes""

&amp;#x200B;

\* Setup your DNS, scopes, etc

&amp;#x200B;

IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is required for PFS use: Failure to do this step will result in the VPN client failing to pass traffic after re-key event. The default MS VPN client IPSEC Child SA settings are 3600 seconds and /250000k. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Go to Advanced section and down to IPSec(IKEV1) client.  Enable PFS (perfect forward secrecy"". While this is listed under the IKEv1 section it's actually used in the IKEv2 settings.  Yah, Go Cisco!

 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Setup your IKEv2 Policies and IPSec Proposals

\------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Advanced"".  Then down to ""IPSec"" tree item and down to ""IKE Policies"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under IKEv2 Policies create an Entry as follows:

DH Group 14, Encryption AES, Integrity Hash ""sha256"" and Pseudo Random Function PRF hash ""sha256"" and lifetime 86400 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\* Setup your IPsec Proposals (Transform Sets).

Go down a menu item to ""IPsec Proposals (Transform Sets)."" 

Under IKE V2 IPsec Proposals:

create an entry with AES and Integrity Hash ""sha-256""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Apply the IPSec Proposals to your Crypto Maps

\-----------------------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Advanced"".  Then down to ""IPSec"" tree item and down to ""Crypto Maps"".

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: This is important because while we created the IKEv2 settings they are not added to the dynamic crypto map for some reason..

&amp;#x200B;

\* Find your ""Dynamic: 65535.x"" dynamic map for outside/inside and edit it:

Under the ""Tunnel Policy (crypto map) - Basic"" tab find the ""ike v2 ipsec proposal"" section and add in ""AES-128/sha-256"" IKEv2 proposal we created above. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Put a check mark next to ""Perfect Forwarding Secrecy "" and select Diffie-Hellman Group:  Group 14

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Install your CA Certificate for Machine cert auth:

\--------------

\* From your Internal CA create a cert and install that onto the ASA

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Certificate Management"""" at the top tree menu and down to ""Identity Certificates"". Pop in your cert and/or go up to CA certs and add it there.  This is used for the machine cert authentication.

\* Name the Associated Trustpoint something like ""VPNMachineCert""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Setup the IPSec(IKEv2) Connection Profiles

\-------------------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to IPSec (IKEv2) Connection Profiles"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Find ""DefaultRAGroup"" and check the box under ""IKEv2 Enabled"".

&amp;#x200B;

Edit the ""DefaultRAGroup"" and perform the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Check box next to ""Enable Certificate Authentication"" under the IKE Peer Authentication section

&amp;#x200B;

\-Check Box next to ""Enable RSA signature Hash"" under the RSA signature section. NOTE: This is used when AES is enabled in the MS VPN Client. If using default settings in the MS Client I believe this may not be used.

&amp;#x200B;

\- In the IKE Local Authentication section: Check the box ""Enable local authentication"" and select ""Certificate"".  In the dropdown box select the cert we want to use.. the trustpoint name would be ""VPNMachineCert"" or whatever you called it. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- User Authentication section server group would be LOCAL

\- Setup your DHCP stuff.. 

\- Default Group Policy:  Select the group policy ""AOVPN"" that we created earlier. Make sure ""Enable IKEv2 Protocol"" is checked below that item.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the left menu tree go into the ""Advanced"" section and down to ""Authorization"". Under authorization section select ""use the entire DN as the username"".

&amp;#x200B;

I believe no other settings are required so okay and exit out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Enable Interfaces for IKEv2

\--------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""AnyConnect Connetion Profiles"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Make sure ""IPSec (IKEv2) Access is enabled on your inside/outside intefaces. So check mark ""allow access"" and ""enable client services"".

&amp;#x200B;

\* Find the ""DefaultRAGroup"" and edit it.  Confirm the following:

Authentication AAA/Local group

Confirm client address pools

Confirm the group policy is still ""Aovpn""

confirm ""enable IPSEC(ikev2) client protocol is checked and DNS/Domain info is in there. 

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: Most likely all this was already configured under the IKEV2 settinsg from before but doesn't hurt to check it here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

MS Windows 10 VPN client. 

\---------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* Windows 10 - in your search bar type ""VPN"" and bring up the VPN settings.

\* Create a VPN connection

VPN Provider: Windows (Built-in)

Connection name ""VPN""

server: your ASA outside IP /DNS name

VPN Type: IKEv2

Type of sign-in info:  certificate

check box next to rememebr my sign-in info.

Save that 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Go into your Windows 10 settings section and find ""Network &amp; Internet""

Select ""change adapter options""

Find your VPN adapter and right-click it:

go to properties and over to the ""Security"" tab:

under the ""Data Encryption"" section move the check box to ""use machine certificates"".

Okay out and save that 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final steps...

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have to harden/change the VPN setup to use AES..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

MS Windows 10 VPN client (harden)

\------------------

\* Command prompt /admin time..   so launch a command prompt

\* Launch powershell

\* Enter the following:

$connection = ""VPN""

Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration -ConnectionName $connection -AuthenticationTransformConstants SHA256128 -CipherTransformConstants AES128 -DHGroup Group14 -EncryptionMethod AES128 -IntegrityCheckMethod SHA256 -PFSgroup PFS2048 -Force

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Launch the VPN client:

\------------------

Click your windows network icon in the lower right and launch the VPN client and connect.  Debug whatever you need to do on the ASA to confirm working.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

AFTER TESTING CONNECTIVITY NOW ITS TIME FOR REVOCATION:

We save this for last since revocation can be a pita to test.

&amp;#x200B;

Setup Certificate Revocation 

\-------------------------

\* Back into ASDM

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Certificate Management"""" at the top tree menu and down to ""CA Certificates"". 

\* Find the Trust point for the Machine certs.. something like ""VPNMachineCert""

\* Edit the Trust Point:

under ""revocation check"" table enable ""Check certificates for revocation"".

Move CRL over to the right side.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under the ""CRL retrieval policy""

Check box ""use CRL distribution point from the certificate""

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under the CRL retrieval method"" 

Disable LDAP

Enable HTTP

&amp;#x200B;

\* Under the ""advanced"" tab:

update your cache timers.  Mine is 60 mines

check box ""enforce next crl update""

other options:  

I have accept certs issued by this CA

Accept certs from the subordinate CAs of this CA

leave CRL check none: (we'll fix this)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And finally... to work around ADSM bug with Enabling the CRL check

\-----------------

\* SSH to your VPN gateway and enable yourself

\* Config T

&amp;#x200B;

Enter into your trust point (example)

&amp;#x200B;

type:  crypto ca trustpoint VPNUSER\_CA

type:  revocation-check crl

type:  crl configure

type:  no protocol ldap

&amp;#x200B;

Note: most likely no protocol ldap was already enabled but .. meh.. you have it again :)

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE2: Perform the steps above for any TrustPoints that have -1 or -2 or whatever else was created. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Revocation Time

\------------

Have your server friends put your machine cert on hold.

Then have them push out the revocation to sub ca's

Then go into ASDM trust point and retrieve CRLS and confirm your client is blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

Then unrevoke, push out changes on server, retrieve CRLS on the ASA and test you can re-connect.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When Revocation/or un-revoke doesnt work:

\------------------

When in doubt do the following:

Have the server team push out revocation changes to the Sub CAs or whatever they do (again).

Go into ASDM and over to the ""Monitoring"" tab at the top and down to ""properties"" in the lower left corner.  

In the Tree menu find ""CRL"" and go into that section.

View ALL CRLs...

Delete /clear all CRLS

Go back to your trust point and update CRLs.

Test again after a minute. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

105,t3_gf3fck,"Hi,

I'm having a hard time setting up an application: A web server sends a command to a second server which in turn relays it using a different protocol to an endpoint. This process takes almost a full minute for something which should be a mere second.

When I manually generate a command on server2, the data is instantly sent and confirmation is returned in under a second.

Using wireshark I captures the packets on the second server to figure out what's going on:

1. I filtered out all traffic that is not between server1 and server 2, there is a bit of TCP, but most of it is DCERPC.
2. Timestamp shows the passed time since the last displayed packet: I see long delays (+20seconds) at some points.
3. I went down the TCPstream until I recognized some of the packet bytes that contain the first command from my code which is meant for the endpoint. (packet #2020)
4. I opened a tcptrace from server1 to server2 and found that this packet #2020 is sent 46 seconds after the TCP stream started.
5. After the start of the TCPstream, I see a 22sec delay, some throughput, and then a delay again for 22 seconds after which the actual command stream starts and then finishes after 6seconds.
6. Looking at the packetstream, each block of data (DCERPC protocol) that comes through is ended by a TCP ACK and then a long delay.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to go from here to figure out what's going on. Any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

Found a mistake: I used a display filter \[ip.src == A &amp;&amp; ip.dst == B\], but forgot to add the inverse.  Now I see all packets back and forth...

My point 6 is thus wrongly interpreted. There is a response from server B saying TCP \[SYN, CWR, ECN\]. This interrupts the connection and results in a DCERPC fault stating the RPC server is unavailable.

Does this mean the application is sending too much data?

After initial setup and verifying that the Bridge is connected and working as intended, i did some ping checks to test the other devices, and here is where i dont get how this is possible. Both the WiFi Bridge and Switch are out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.

Here is a small michelangelo to show what pings work and which dont (it looks as confusing as it is to me)

both laptops and the management interfaces (that were used to ping) on switch and router are in the [192.168.169.128/25](https://192.168.169.128/25) subnet. the wifi bridge's mgmt interface is configured via DHCP by a DHCP server in the company network. DHCP does currently not work on the switch/laptop behind the bridge.

my main confusion right now is why the switch cannot ping ANYTHING at all, even though the connection from laptop to laptop or laptop to wifi bridge works.

110,t3_gf0doj,"I have been running in circle for the past few hours trying to solve this. I have a ASA (SiteB) with two site-to-site VPNs connected to it:

SiteA and SiteC

Both site to site VPN are working fine. But I am trying to set up a double NAT hairpinning so that the devices at SiteC can reach a server at siteA.

SiteA servers: 10.10.x.x

SiteB devices: 172.17.1.x

SiteC devices: 172.17.2.x

Internal devices at SiteB can reach the server at SiteA using a double NAT, but when I use a similar double NAT for the traffic from SiteC, it seems like the ASA is only translating the source IP and not the destination.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the config on SiteB ASA:

    nat (inside,outside) source static INTERNAL-NETWORKS NAT-INTERNAL-NETWORKS destination static NAT-SERVER REAL-SERVER
    
    nat (outside,outside) source static SITEC-NETWORKS NAT-SITEC-NETWORKS destination static NAT-SERVER REAL-SERVER

This is the error I am getting in the log:

Customer has two WatchGuard M200s in a Active/Passive configuration and in this configuration you need to have everything patched to both the M200s concurrently (e.g. LAN, DMZ, Internet etc.) so that in a failure it will failover within 1-2 packet drops.

\#Primary Issue#

The customer has a NBN FTTP internet connection that has a single ethernet hand off from the NTD - this needs to be plugged into two M200's concurrently.

They have been plugging the ethernet hand off into a 5-port hub switch then having two other ports plug into the M200s. 

They currently have stacked N3000 L3 POE switches that would be a much better use case than an non-managed / non-redundant hub switch.

Now i've configured the N3000's with a port channel (e.g. PO4) on the interfaces gi1/0/44-45 &amp; gi2/0/44-45 with switchport access vlan 30 configured.

The concept was that you would plug in the ethernet hand off into gi1/0/44 then have gi1/0/45 &amp; gi2/0/45 plugged into the M200s (gi2/0/44 in case gi1/0/44 dies, you simply move the ethernet hand off). 

The issue is that when I plugged in these ports from the N3000s into the M200s the interface is shown as failed on the watchguard. 

I'm assuming that it might be because I've not configured the WatchGuard external internet interface with the VLAN ID and/or no link aggregation - would this be correct or is there anything else that needs to be considered?

So what am I missing here? [MIB documentation](http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/mibs/host.html) says the table and fields are named as described in my telegraf configuration.",Telegraf not putting storage data into Influx?,r/networking,1.0,17,1588831597.0,,,6
117,t3_getnoy,"I don't have much in the place in regards to network monitoring. I send logs to our ELK stack, so I capture BGP events, and I'm monitoring system resources and interface stats with our infrastructure monitoring tools.

I'd like to get something like smokeping in place to keep an eye on things from a general reachability perspective, and have some history of that info.

But another thing I think would be really useful is route snapshots. Something that grabs the routing table every minute or so, diffs it and notes when there are changes. Is there a tool that can do this, or is this something that's typically available via SNMP and maybe my current tools just don't support it?

We've had some incidents where there was an outage during the night, and while troubleshooting the next day, it's pretty difficult to tell what actually happened. And I'm thinking if I could see the routing tables at the time where there were dips on the traffic graphs, it would cut the troubleshooting time way down.",Monitoring question - routing table snapshots,r/networking,0.85,8,1588831421.0,,,4
118,t3_getnbr,"We recently purchased a new AIR-AP1562E-B-K9 AP and it seems to only want to join one of our two controllers. The join request to our first controller fails and then connects to the back up controller.

Controllers are on 8.3.150.0 (WLC-5508s)

Clients are able to connect to the AP and then every couple minutes the AP shows DTLS failing and it reconnects to the controller again.

Time is correct and I have disabled LSC and MIC expire checks.

119,t3_gesdop,"So I always questioned this as this is the third time i'm now seeing this.  And for what it's worth, i'm using the IOS-XR O/S.

We have our aggregate routers in our core in which we have all of our static to null's for our larger prefixes.  Not to get into too many of the technicalities of the physical topology, because it's def not ideal and we're in the midst of changing it, but for discussion's sake, say Site B hangs off of Site A, which in turn is connected to the ""internet"".  Site B advertises a /22 to Site A.  Site A has a static to Null for that /22 with an AD of 250 set.  When you do a route lookup on Site A to this /22, it shows as an eBGP peer.  

This link went down between the two Agg routers in both sites and thus, the static to null for this /22 took precedence.  When the link came back up, the static to null was still there, and the lower AD /22 route did not take precedence.

Is this because they're the same length even though the static to null has a higher AD?  I would think the eBGP AD of 20 would trump the 250 we have configured even with the same prefix length.",Why is a static to null route with a higher AD still preferred over the same length prefix from eBGP peer?,r/networking,0.92,43,1588827330.0,,,30

We use Cisco equipment, and recently purchased a Cradlepoint router to use as a failover. we configured the cradlepoint in IP Passthrough and purchased a static IP from Verizon.

We are able to get out to the internet with this interface, but unable to bring up the VPN tunnel, as the peer does not respond. (MM\_WAIT\_MSG2)

We have double checked, and triple checked to config. Our primary outside interface comes up fine and without issue, but we are pretty stumped on this one. Using nmap from a computer on the inside interface, the peer connection we are trying to connect to shows port 500 as open.

121,t3_ger4qc,I know this has probably been covered or asked before in some form or another but it has been a long day so please forgive me. I am looking at a /16 range which is mostly unused. Anything that is configured on the network or actually in use is as /24 subnets and I have a list of those subnets. I was wondering if there was a tool that can summarise the gaps between these in use /24 subnets?

**SOLVED**

My private subnet only allowed traffic from my `10.0.0.0/16` VPC but the VPN is on `10.8.0.0/16`.

Changing the private security group to include the VPN CIDR made it work.

---

First of all, I apologies if it's not the good place for posting.
But, while I'm not sure it's an AWS or OpenVPN issue, I'm positive it's a networking one.

Also, I'm new to all this, from AWS to VPN and networking in general.
Don't hesitate to tell me if I need to give more detail of any sort.
Despite the fact I'm new to it, it's for my work place, not home networking at all.

Feel free to remove this post if I'm definitively lost.
If you keep it, I'll be able to cross post on r/aws and r/openvpn.

---

So, here is the thing : https://gitlab.com/pcoves/vpn_test

This is a small network (single VPC) hosted on AWS composed of :
1. One OpenVPN server with a public IPv4 address on a public subnet (10.0.0.0/24),
2. Two Debian instances in a private subnet (10.0.1.0/24) that can be joined from within the VPC.

Note that the VPN server [does](https://gitlab.com/pcoves/vpn_test/-/blob/master/packer/ansible/roles/openvpn/files/server.conf#L22) `push ""route 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0""` so that the client is aware of the AWS subnet.

I can `ssh` from my local box to the VPN server (using either it's public ip or `10.8.0.1` so I know the VPN is working) and from there, I can `ssh` to the private instances.
Once I'm on the private instances, I can `ping`/`ssh` back to the VPN server.
So, I know, each machine can communicate with the other on the `10.0.0.0/16` VPC.

Now, I'd like to access my private subnet from my local box through the VPN.
As far as I understand, when I do `ping 10.0.1.*` from my local (192.168.*.*) box, it goes to the VPN server, then goes to the private machine (I don't know how to verify that, you know, new to networking... Open to suggestion).
Once there, the `ping` has to *come back* but the private machine has no clue what `10.8.0.1` (the VPN server) so the packets are lost.

So, my question really is : what does one has to do in order to route the packets from the private subnet to the local machine through the VPN?

Many thanks in advance for your patience!

PS : many pages on the net advise to disable the *source/dest check* on the VPN server instance.

138,t3_gehxc6,"My company is currently working to provide a large enterprise customer with a private AWS web application accessed via IPSec tunnels. We are in initial discussion with the customer's various IT/Networking teams but are working out possible architectures before the full design coordination meeting.

&amp;nbsp;

**Key components of our current VPC design:**

* VPC is a /16 RFC 1918 space e.g. 10.1.0.0/16
* Access to the application is via an internal AWS ALB with multiple AZs.  
* The ALB client endpoint IPs are private and dynamically assigned and updated in DNS.


**Anticipated Customer Constraints**

* To avoid IP conflicts, Customer will not peer/reserve/route to RFC 1918
* We need to provide target IPs in advance (static IPs/CIDRs)
* Future changes are slow.  Stable design is important upfront.

&amp;nbsp;

We are looking at ways to solve this and came across what is probably a bad idea, but we can't see why.

&amp;nbsp;

What if our company purchased and registered a public /24 but did not advertise routes on the public internet.  Instead we add our new public range to the VPC as usable IPs (again not publicly routable or registered with AWS for public advertisement).  We then configure the load balancer to use IPs from this CIDR as it's endpoint addresses.  

&amp;nbsp;

To the customer, we provide this new privately-owned ""public"" range which they route across our B2B IPSec tunnel. 

Conceivably this guarantees no conflicts on their end and makes it easy for us to dynamically use IPs from a given subnet (rather than randomly assigned non-contiguous AWS EIPs).  


&amp;nbsp;

Here's the crazy idea:  What if we reused this architecture and ""public"" CIDR with multiple customers (lets say 25 unique large enterprises)?  

&amp;nbsp;

*Pros:*

* We only have to buy one public CIDR block.
* Design is standard and reproducible for customers
* Customer only has to configure routes for a single subnet rather than multiple /32 addresses.

*Cons:*

* Our org cannot access multiple customer stacks simultaneously without DNAT. (not an issue for us)
* Cannot advertise public CIDR on the internet.

Configuration B:

I favor configuration B - it makes more sense to me. I've never liked split-brain scenarios when it seems they're easily avoidable. But I work in the SMB space which means two things: 1. I don't get to see much public facing configuration done by others, so I don't have a good sense of what's standard and 2.

Not worried about pads and smartphones, those dont get to access the corporate network.

VLAN1 is where someone ends up when no valid certificate is present and can obtain a certificate, and VLAN2 would be the corporate network accessible with a valid certificate and corresponding private key

Is there any way to make this network re-auth more user friendly? Preferably have someone re-authenticate automatically within mere seconds after obtaining the certificate?

Conversely, if the internal server needs to access the public internet, a source NAT would overwrite the source IP with \*something\*.  This \*something\*, if configured to be the same public IP that is used for the destination NAT, would seem to be essentially a static NAT.  However, there are other options that can be inserted for \*something\*.  For example, you can insert the IP of the egress interface for all outbound traffic, or you can choose from a shared pool of public IPs.  My question, then, is about in which use case you would want to use the static NAT (with outbound traffic for the server using the same source address as inbound traffic) over the combined source / destination NAT (with outbound traffic using a shared source IP)?  It seems that topology hiding is the main purpose of the source NAT, and using the combined source / destination NAT seems more secure in that respect.

171,t3_gdlhd6,"TL;DR - Is it feasible to use ACLs to (partially) mitigate DDoS attacks assuming you have the bandwidth to withstand the attack? Obvious drawbacks?

Assumptions:

- eyeball network, no public servers or services

- need to protect shared (CGNAT) IPs

- 100G links to upstreams

- cutting down attacks so that less than 10G of mixed dirty/clean traffic is passed on is enough. 10G or less can be scrubbed with on-prem resources.



Basic approach when detecting attack is to automatically put up ACLs for the target IPs. For example like this:

- drop everything that isn't TCP. Gamers might complain, but grandma can still get to Facebook. Anybody not using ISP provided DNS servers can use DoH/DoT for the duration.

- drop incoming TCP SYN packets. Nobody is (supposedly) hosting anything critical on shared IPs.

- drop incoming TCP fragments, resets and packets to ports 0-1024

- drop all traffic from out of region RIR's /8s

- possibly whitelist some prefixes from major content providers. Depending on how large ACL lists you can support, kind of a reverse SIR approach



When the above fails, blackhole the target IPs upstream.

Theory: service degradation is better than no service. Hence cutting down on what the customers can access is an acceptable tradeoff, if it means withstanding the attack. Bonus points for being able to gather some information about the attacks and being able to complain to appropriate parties to cut down on the crap.

Background: new routers will have 100G interfaces. Instead of getting the usual 10G links, ordering 10G commits on 100G interfaces is a possibility, thus having ample headroom on top of normal traffic levels to deal with some DDoS attacks.

Disclaimer: I haven't built DDoS mitigation systems before, just plain firewalls. I currently don't have any DDoS attacks to deal with, so can't speak from experience.

I understand this might be a stupid idea, but from stupid ideas might come better ideas after generous application of clue stick.

Recently migrated over an NSA from a SonicWALL NSA 2600 to a Fortigate 300E. Migration went well, but an issue has cropped up in the past few days.

The SonicWALL (and now, Fortigate) has a bunch of IPSec VPN tunnels that all point to a windows server located on one of the subnets behind the NSA. Each tunnel has a separate virtual IP NATed to the internal IP of that server. These tunnels have a super specific purpose to send/recieve really small amounts of data to an EMR system and they have extremely low usage at any moment. They're all working, but the most data I've seen go through any of them in a single day is 100kb max. Not 100kb/s, 100kb over the course of a 24 hour period.  

Here's where the issue starts - since the migration, the server those tunnels point to regularly grinds to a halt throughout the day. Normally I'd be suspicious but literally no other servers in the environment are experiencing this, and it just so happens to be the one with all of these NAT IPs that the tunnels all point back to. I've run packet captures on these tunnels and there isn't really a whole lot going on at any moment yet the server grinds to a halt with all resources maxed out about 3-4 times a day. I've changed the SSL inspection rules and checked DPI but can anyone think of something that could be causing this? I did a brief experiment and putting the old SonicWALL back in cleared up the issue. I've checked the MTU size and made sure the tunnels are 1-1 and still no dice.

181,t3_gddkes,"Hi Guys,

I've run into an issue that's stumping me and my team.  Thought I might throw it out here in case someone had seen something similar.

We have two public IPs on an ASA where the HTTPS services behind those IPs are not reachable.  Other IPs in the same subnet on the ASA are working fine.  I've got a packet capture on the client machine and on the ASA.  The initial TCP handshake is failing with ""TCP ACKed unseen segment"".  The packets in the captures are lining up, so it doesn't look like anything is missed by the capture, but there is something weird in the TCP sequence numbers.

When the initial SYN packet leaves the client, it has TCP seq (raw) 3740762526 but in the capture on the ASA, it has seq 1413747879.  The packet goes on to the server and the ASA captures a SYN, ACK reply matching seq 141...  Then the client sees the reply with the same SEQ and ACK number that left the ASA, but these no longer match the original SYN packet on the client and thus the handshake fails.

Client ----- ASASEQ, ACK ----- SEQ, ACK3740762526, 0 -----&gt; 1413747879, 0820296656, 1413747880 &lt;----- 820296656, 1413747880

What am I missing here?  What would cause the seq number to change between the time it leaves the client but before it hits the edge firewall on the other side?

Thanks!

185,t3_gd66i5,"Okay so I don't fully understand some basic things about networking. This is how I think it works, at some point my understanding is gone.

I know I have one public IP address, every ping I send from my router, no matter if I use my ""Computer A"" or my ""Computer B"", will be seen as the same IP address, the public one. I hope I got this right.

Then, every device connected to that router, has a unique internal/local IP. I can ping Computer A from Computer B using its local IP as long as I'm under the same network.

My understanding starts to fall short there. If I have an ubuntu server in one machine and it has some LXD/LXC containers inside, I guess the host machine also works as a router, and all those containers are together in a local network. Pretty much like my ""real"" setup but all done virtually inside a single machine.

Some things are still easy if I set it up like this. I can use those LXD containers to access the internet, and I can run services from there, for example, I've been running a noip service inside a container and works nicely. I've also been running a couple bots inside containers and they also work nicely.

The issue comes when I try to connect to one of those machines from the internet.

If I host, let's say, a Minecraft server on a computer on my local network, I can give someone the public IP and the port and he can use it to connect to my computer. I don't quite know how is this done but I guess it's all about the port. My best guess is that only my machine is listening to that specific port, so any packet coming to my router gets to my computer. I don't fully understand this, but I know it works.

The thing is... How would I connect to a container inside a machine on my local network? As far as my understanding goes, the container would be listening at packets arriving to the specific port of its host machine, not to the router hosting the local network.

My understanding tells me that I need to point the packets to that specific machine instead of pointing them to the router. But since I only have one public IP, how do I do it?

There is something I don't quite understand because if I am not mistaken, when you ping a machine the ping has to go out and come back. And if I ping from the LXD container to the internet, the ping goes out and back in.

So there has to be a way to point for that specific machine from the exterior. But I don't understand.

I have been getting into Cisco networking and I'm attempting to emulate my work so I can do some labbing.  Got GNS3 all setup and it's working great doing with an ASA image with a couple of Routers.  So I decided to kick it up a notch and add 2 more routers to make my topology realistic.  Total 4 Routers + 1 ASA firewall.  yeah I thought my MBP was going to melt, the fan was blasting and it was too hot to even put it my lap, and the topology wouldn't stay up and kept going down.   So now I'm wondering, what kind of hardware would someone need to run 4-5 Routers and 1 FW...or possibly even 2 Firewalls?  I can't imaging once I start adding configs, it might become even more and more cpu-intesive.

Our server team has opened up a ticket with us that they’re not able to hit 100Gbps speeds on data transfer between two hosts connected to the fabric.  They are declaring the service level is not met, and are rejecting our deliverable.

When they are transferring a 1TB file they are hitting speeds around 1-1.5Gbps on the line according to interface statistics.

We have verified there is no interface errors, no discards, and the end to end path has negotiated to 100GB.

I asked them to adjust their TCP window size to ensure maximum throughput, to which they said “that’s not a thing.”  After pushing back they opened up a case with Microsoft who basically came back and said TCP Window is not adjustable on Server 2019 OS and that it scales the window size automatically to fill the pipe up.

So I got my CCNA and got my first networking job. We have a small customer who bought a router from us and wishes to use it with their existing pppoe connection. They don’t have their own IT, just a 3rd party support, and we asked them for the connection type so that we can pre-configure the router prior shipping.

So according to them we need to set a static IP on the PPPoE interface but with the subnet mask of /32..?

Since I’m a newbie , I did not want to question their network engineer, but even my colleagues were surprised (they are located in the US, so they are not really familiar with this type of “old connection”).

Is there a gap in my knowledge regarding any speciality with pppoe or did the guy just made a typo and he wanted to write /30 for p2p connection ?

Any comments are highly appreciated, thanks",Am I missing something ? /32 subnet mask for PPPoE,r/networking,0.5,0,1588450861.0,,,9

203,t3_gc4vxv,"Hi - we are a small hospital that recently upgraded our Fortigate firewall from 5.6.11 to 6.2.3 per their recommendations. The upgrade went smoothly, albeit a couple minor issues, one being that our SSLVPN users couldn't reach our internal ADFS / SSO server due to a caveat in the new code, which tech support was able to remedy by enabling auxiliary session ([https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/6.2.3/technical-tip-enabling-auxiliary-session-with-ecmp-or-sd-wan/19/fd47765](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/6.2.3/technical-tip-enabling-auxiliary-session-with-ecmp-or-sd-wan/19/fd47765)**)**

However, one issue remains, and that is that a healthcare org that we closely work with is no longer able to reach our EMR (which is publicly accessible via a pub DNS record and SSL cert), as well as our VMware View connection server. Both of these should be reachable over 443, and from our firewall rules should be allowed in. I've confirmed I am able to publicly hit both from the internet, regardless of where I am, can access both on my smartphone for example, AND I can successfully access both via this healthcare org's PUBLIC wifi (seperate network).

But this healthcare org it seems to be timing out when navigating via https while on their wired and secure wifi network - the telnet port tests show connectivity over 443, but to me it seems like a TLS issue - their web browsers are showing ""Cannot connect to this site securely"". I don't have any control over this org but as far as their IE Security options go, they allow TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, but they're all grayed out due to GPO policy that I can't edit. They say they are allowing all 3 and I believe them based on what I see, but why can't they then hit our 2 sites on 443 securely?

The POC I worked with Friday said he whitelisted our domains with wildcard entries for our domain name on their webfilter, but I'm still skeptical. If I can reach these sites right now from my home machine, what would make this ""our issue""?

204,t3_gc47n6,"Hi,

i'm here to ask help to identify the root cause of a FTTH connection that is acting very poorly to open files via SSL VPN.

Here the spec:

* 60 mbit up/down symmetic FTTH Connection. Is a business grade one with bandwidth reservation (600€/month)
* Zywall USG 210 Router Firewall.
* The server on i'm opening the files is a Windows 2016 file server VM, full patched, 4 core, 6 gb RAM.
* The infrastracture in new: 2 HP DL380 Gen10, 10 gbit networking between the 2 esxi host and principal switch

Previusly, we had a RDSL 15 mbit download and 3 mbit up at that site and opening a file took actually less time.

What i'm seeing: when i'm connected via SSL VPN (provided by the Zywall) to that server, if i try to open a 3 Mbyte excel file i get Excel freezing for about 10 second, then i see that excel is actually opening the file, i see the progress about at 15% increments, each one last about 3/4 second.

Total time to open a 3 mbyte file is about 40 second. This doesn't change if i use my workstation or another, or if i have Excel already opened or not.

What i've done until now:

* Tested bandwidth: i have a full 60 mbit down/60 mbit up with 2/3 msec ping from a speedtest
* I've adjust the MTU of the wan port to 1490, as i see it started to fragment at 1464 size and does not at 1462
* Running iperf from my home connection using VPN i get transfer speed about 12/15 Mbits. I have a 100/20 mbit connection at home and it was not loaded with other tasks at the moment (netflix,ecc)
* The problem does not occupr on local Lan
* Running Wireshark at my point. I get some TCP Spurios Rentransmission error and TCP Dup ACK error repeatly.

In wireshark i tried to get some data (this data has been created today, when the performance seems a little better but i'm the only one connected today, yesterday with 5 people via VPN the opening time in SMB2 report was 23 seconds)

208,t3_gby8gx,"I know what you're probably thinking - but hear me out.

Recently, a vendor ran two CAT6 links from an IDF inside the org (CAT5e patch panel) to a terminal outside the building to support network connectivity for a temporary structure we've put up.

I installed a 3750 (48x FE copper, x4 GE SFP) in the structure and configured it to trunk with a 6500 chassis which sits inside the IDF. When it came time to plug everything in, I found that the interfaces which were supposed to be trunking were actually in a notconnect state. The configs are super simple - no VLAN pruning or native VLAN bullshit. Just ""switchport mode trunk"" on both sides. So, I started looking at the hardware.

I swapped SFPs (tried multiple GLC-TE and GLC-T copper SFPs), tried multiple GE interfaces on the 3750 and 6500, swapped cables (CAT5e and CAT6), verified speed/duplex settings, etc. Nothing worked.

I finally yanked the trunk link from the GE interface of the 3750 and slapped it into a FE interface - and behold, it worked! Trunk was up, phones started registering, etc.

For the sake of troubleshooting, I swapped out the 3750 for a brand new 9300 and tried again. No dice. The trunk simply won't come up on a 1Gb interface.

I need the 1Gb uplink to support some bandwidth-hungry equipment which will sit in the temporary structure. I only have two copper lines, so the best I can do with a port channel is 200Mb/s on the 3750.

The vendor claims that they used CAT6 cables all the way through and terminated on a CAT5e patch panel in our IDF. I assume , but do not know, that the temporary structure (which was brought to us by a vendor and already has some cabling infrastructure) uses CAT5e at least, since they have their own gigabit switches which they offered to provide for us.

I want to create a three-point WiFi network with 50-100m in between each device. For now at least, may increase in range in the future. Planning on using three Ubiquity LocoM2 devices or something similar and provide wireless internet access. 

When clients connect to the said network they should get an IP address via DHCP but due to security concerns, I need to have them isolated from each other. 

Each client should seem like in different subnet and without possibility to scan or detect other devices connected to the same network.


The whole plan is like this:

* The network can be on 2.4GHz and/or 5GHz, dual-band will be excellent but for the initial testing only on 2.4GHz would suffice.
* Client devices must be isolated when connected.
* The AP's will have a full line of sight visibility, there will be no interference.
* Some bandwidth limit or burst limit, so one client couldn't take up full utilization of the link.
* Thinking about 10Mbit/s U/D for now, and around 20 clients on average.
* VPN connection for central monitoring and configuration.

220,t3_gbhw8b,"Hi all, I've got two questions relating to data centre networking, firstly is if I've got our new re-design correct in my head and secondly following that plan we'll have an increased reliance on ACLs on our switches and I wanted to know if there's an easier GUI based way to manage ACLs.

Firstly, our current set up consists of an HA pair of firewalls doing all L3 in the DC, including all inter-VLAN traffic which is the main reason we want to move away from this set up. The firewalls have an internet breakout, WAN link DMZ and multiple other VLANs on them, prod, test, dev, voice, SQL etc. We currently manage rules between VLANs using the firewalls which have a decent GUI making it simpler to manage and harder to make mistakes. South of those firewalls is a pair of nexus 5k switches, 3 UCS chassis and a iSCSI SAN.

The problem with this is that there's only a 1gbps link between the nexus and the active firewall with all of the default gateways for our VLANs being sub interfaces on the 1gbps interface. Not a great design I know, we used to have a pair of 3925s doing our inter-VLAN routing with ACLs controlling traffic between VLANs. They were a bit of a pain to manage as there was only me at the time who had knowledge of working with them. Our MSP suggested those routers were unnecessary when they upgraded our firewalls (the previous ones only had 10/100 interfaces). We've grown a lot since the last upgrade though and are back in a position where we need to re-think things.

The plan is to use the Nexus switches for the inter-VLAN routing (they're currently only doing L2). Create a new small subnet between the Nexus switches and the firewalls and set the default route on the Nexus to point at the new firewall IP.  This plan takes all of the inter-VLAN traffic away from the firewalls, freeing them up to do what they were intended for. However, we lose the nice GUI based method for controlling our inter-vlan traffic and would be back to ACLs on the Nexus switches (something I'd like to avoid). Is there a solution that can help us manage the ACLs with a GUI and ideally where changes can be verified before being made? We use proper Cisco in our datacentre but are migrating to Meraki in our branches and their dashboard has spoilt me with how easy it is.

I also cannot RDP via VPN into any other workstations or servers on the network besides my own, which isn't configured any differently in RDP settings than any of the other machines.

Discovered that RemoteVPN-&gt;DNS setting is pointing to old decom'd DC, so I fixed the setting and am able to reach payroll server until HR person tried to RDP into it and then everyone was locked out again except myself to my own workstation.

***April 13*** \- Everyone's ability to RDP suddenly came back up, then dropped, then came back up again by the end of the day.

I discovered a No NAT rule that allows all trusted users access to all necessary internal VLANs, and the only ""deny"" ACLs I could find are blocking QUIC and ""hostile traffic"" which doesn't seem to have anything to do with RDP.

***April 21*** \- RDP stopped working again for office staff, so I did a packet capture while unsuccessfully trying to RDP into the payroll server:

Tried  ***sh cap asp | inc x.x.x.x*** (payroll server ip) which showed no drops from the firewall.

***April 22*** \- I noticed on the the Firewall Dashboard in ASDM that the workstations denying RDP access are listed at ""Top 10 Protected Servers under SYN Attack"" and sure enough, there are the ip addresses of the Business Officec computers plus the 3389 port #.

I then learned [this](https://layer77.net/2014/02/14/fixing-broken-microsoft-rdp-connections-through-a-cisco-asa-terminating-a-site-to-site-vpn/), and lowered the TCPMSS to 1300 and everyone's RDP started working again for almost a week ...

***April 28*** \- Discovered that the RemoteVPN-&gt;DNS setting keeps reverting back to the old decommissioned DC, so I sent this info to Cisco TAC.

***Yesterday*** \- the Business Manager and I were able to to RDP into everything, but other staff could not connect to their workstations.  I asked Cisco TAC if the ASA has some kind of DNS mapping in its config that's causing the VPN/DNS settings to revert, so they looked at my ""show tech"" and noticed that a firewall-object-network object had been configured linking the old DC to the ip address which now belongs to the new DC. So, I fixed that to point to the new DC.

The Business Manager lost her ability to RDP around 2pmEST, so I did a packet trace to her machine, and am waiting to hear back fro Cisco still, and there's a Zoom Board Meeting on Tuesday that's breathing down my neck ...

Edit - first of all, this subreddit is full of amazing, helpful, brilliant people. Secondly, support is awesome to have and there's no way to know everything about everything in this field and I honestly regret the critical tone of my title. Everywhere is a hot mess right now and I'm no exception ... 

I believe I may have isolated the issue - deep within an undocumented setting in the Content Filter, I found a tiny range of IP addresses with a ""full bypass"" in the VPN internal client subnet. I broadened the IP range a little, did a /release /flush /renew on my laptop, and now RDP works (for now?). Since the Content Filter is in place to monitor student internet activity, it didn't occur to me that it might be interfering with VPN traffic in a totally different subnet. Especially since the packet traces were showing a TCP connection to the target machine.  And  the RDP issue started the day after the ASA software update, but this just goes to show ...

What are your thoughts on best practices on SNMP trap handling for routers and switches?

At my workplace we had a discussion and have 2 options:

1. Activate all snmp traps that are possible on each device and let the monitoring tool filter what events are important (and which ones should raise Incidents)

2. Activate just the snmp traps that are interesting for us (our configs differ a lot today. We would need to define templates for each device model)",SNMP trap handling best practices on routers,r/networking,0.63,2,1588339132.0,,,2

Have 1Gbps business line from Comcast that we manage in our lab. Enterprise recommends we swap to the “enterprise lab infrastructure” that they manage.

The problem is the throughput is total crap compared to what we currently have.

Our lab ran internet connection is a Comcast 1Gbps business line. The enterprise one is supposedly a 1Gbps CenturyLink connection they route around over  their MPLS circuits in the same city but eventually hits the 1Gbps CL (at least that’s what I gather).

There shouldn’t be any issue to the “end user” between the two. I can understand some variance but the CL connection is a total dog for throughput in comparison to basically 95% of sites. Yeah you can pull up a browser and browse around but downloading any type of packages (OS packages, datasets, etc) it’s way slower than 90% of them.

We noticed it when updating our servers with drivers (like 400MB NVidia drivers) from Ubuntu mirrors. Our old connection could easily download this at 50-60MB/s (400-500Mbps) and be done in seconds. The new connection we get like 1-5MB/s (10-50Mbps).

After seeing this from multiples sources. I went and did some testing from vultr, AWS, FDCServers, Ramnode, DigitalOcean etc. Downloading files from those data centers in the same city (Seattle) on the old connection with 3-6ms pings we can get 80+MB/s. Most of them are 90+MB/s. The new connection varies from 8-12MB/s on one test from one of the providers and all the others are between 2-5MB/s (in seattle).

Running tests from different city’s LA, San Fran, Denver, ATL, Chicago, NYC, Washington DC. The Comcast connection slows down some depending on the distance but it’s routinely above 30MB/s on all of them. The new “enterprise” connection is between 1-2MB/s.

I ran the same tests on my home connection (Google Fiber) across the country (AL) to these same data centers in Seattle and get better speeds than this “enterprise” connection.

I’ve complained about it and enterprise just tells me “it’s the general internet” we can’t do anything. I’m like there HAS to be something wrong somewhere otherwise this thing is borderline useless. If it’s the “general internet” get CL to prove that because this thing is dog slow to _EVERY_ damn site. There is not a single site it’s even close on. Then they just tell us our TCP window size is too small or some shit when basically the same system 2 feet away is getting 80MB/s. 

I tested about 15-20 different sources spread across the country. And the comcast connection never had one below 10MB/s (100Mbps) even from ATL to Seattle or Washington DC to seattle. The new connection I think there was 1 or 2 that was 10-15MB/s the rest were in the 5MB/s even from Seattle.


Is there anything that you would want to see that would be hard to deny that there is a problem? Maybe it is the “general” internet being shit and CL is total shit in their peering or routing or whatever but is there anyway to prove that? Or am I just wrong and CL is just _that_ bad?

EDIT because I really should have mentioned in the original post:  
1) NO DUO.  This service is used by non-interactive batch processes.  No humans are controlling or initiating these sessions.  
2) We're NOT using IP addresses for authentication/authorization.  They're only used to decide whether we send notifications to tech contacts on the partner's account.  For instance, if there's a good login from an IP address the customer has registered with their account, we just add the login to an audit log.  If there's a good login from an unregistered IP address, we send the tech contact a notice (up to 4 per day).  If there's a bad login from a registered IP address, we just log the bad login, but lock the account and send an alert after 5 bad logins.  Bad logins from unregistered IP address cause the account to lock for bit and source IP address gets blocked for an hour.  If this happens for 3 times in a 24 hour period, we lock the account and send the partner a new username to use.

234,t3_gb5zma,"I have a bridge interface, and what I am trying to do is when I send ARP requests out of it (exiting eth0) I want the ""Sender IP address"" and ""Sender MAC address"" that is within ARP packet to change. I've tried for days with `arptables`, but I can't seem to figure it out. 

To illustrate what I mean, say I do this command to send an ARP request:

    nping --arp 10.99.99.99 -c 0 -e br0 --source-mac 11:22:33:44:55:FF --arp-sender-mac 11:22:33:44:55:FF --arp-sender-ip 10.1.1.1

This command sends the following across the network:

    Ethernet frame
    ---------------
    Src MAC:    11:22:33:44:55:FF
    Dst MAC:    FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
    
    ARP Packet
    ---------------
    Sender IP:  10.1.1.1
    Sender MAC: 11:22:33:44:55:FF
    Target IP:  10.99.99.99
    Target MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:00

So far, that's expected behavior. However, I'd like netfilter to change all the information. I can easily change the source MAC in the Ethernet frame as they leave eth0 with `ebtables`:

    ebtables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j snat --to-source FE:ED:FA:CE:BE:EF
    
Then I will see this in Wireshark:

    Ethernet frame
    ---------------
    Src MAC:    FE:ED:FA:CE:BE:EF
    Dst MAC:    FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
    
    ARP Packet
    ---------------
    Sender IP:  10.1.1.1
    Sender MAC: 11:22:33:44:55:FF
    Target IP:  10.99.99.99
    Target MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:00

Despite the ""Src MAC"" changing in the Ethernet frame, it's unchanged in the ARP packet. So, I try with `arptables` to change the Sender MAC and Sender IP to no avail. I've tried many variations of these commands with no effect:

    arptables -I OUTPUT -j mangle -o eth0 --mangle-ip-s 1.2.3.4
    arptables -I OUTPUT -j mangle -o eth0 --mangle-mac-s FE:ED:FA:CE:BE:EF
    arptables -I OUTPUT -o eth0 --opcode request -j mangle --mangle-ip-s 1.2.3.4

None of these will change any aspect of the ARP packet.

Due to the incorrect information within the ARP header, some ARP requests are not receiving responses. I did find some (but very few) resources online that accomplish exactly what I want.

246,t3_gazl58,Hi guys. I am currently trying to learn a few new things and thought I would give Ansible a go. Have it up and running and am able to log into a router I have but am unable to run any commands on it. The router is an Alcatel-Lucent Omniswitch and it doesn't appear to be one of the supported ansible_network_os variables. I have tried just using another just to get Ansible to connect which works but probably most other OS are setup to use command heirarchy and privelleges and configuration mode whereas as with Alcatel there is none of that just run any configure or show commands etc as soon as you log in to CLI. Is there anyway I can configure Ansible to manage these as a simple SSH CLI device without it manipulating the commands I want it to run? Thanks.,Help for Ansible beginner please,r/networking,0.57,1,1588294868.0,,,3

I am trying to run the command show license detail with netmiko for a list of cisco xe devices through a proxy server (jumpserver). I keep getting intermittent ssh banner timeout errors. I have set the banner\_timeout value to 250 and timeout value to 200. Still it seems to happen to some devices intermittently. Tried running them through the jumpserver itself and the issue does occur but fewer devices have that error.I am able to ssh to them manually. Is the solution only to keep increasing the timeout value ?. Would using API instead of ssh help in getting over the issue? how to resolve this issue?

249,t3_gaz3de,"So, I've been lurking here for a bit in an effort to learn some things and get an idea of what awaits me after I graduate next month with a degree in IT and cyber security.  For some context, I'm 41, have a previous degree in communications and have been in the telecommunications field for about 15 years.  While I have a 4.0 GPA, the degree I am about to finish is only an Associates so I'm already worried about my potential job prospects.  

Now, I do have a decent amount of networking and consulting experience.  While I am certainly no expert, I do have certain applicable knowledge with general infrastructure, group policy management, VLANs, static IPs, wireless configuration, network design and so on.  Pretty much basic stuff to most of you by the looks of it.  

The thing is, I'm already old as hell and after seeing some of the topics discussed here, I'm terrified that I do not know nearly enough to enter into this field with any sort of confidence.  I understand that sys admins and even junior admins acquire their knowledge through years of experience, and that's generally why I am worried that I may be regulated to help desk type jobs.  Which is not to say help desk positions are not valued or satisfying, it just that I'm not sure if it would be a career advancement above what I currently do.  


TLDR: You guys discuss a lot of networking topics that are beyond my comprehension and despite graduating soon, my age and current knowledge level make me extremely worried that I will have a difficult time finding a good job.

255,t3_gashhw,"Hi all,

I think i'm missing something silly here, but after setting up a site-to-site VPN between an SRX and an ASA, the phase 1 IKE (v2) comes up fine, but Phase 2 never does, nor does it even seem like its ever trying.

The story here is that SRX has replaced a Draytek, so the ASA has stayed the same and im sure the config is still fine on that.

Some details:

ASA local Subnet: [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24)

SRX local subnet: [192.168.2.0/24](https://192.168.2.0/24)

Originally I thought the issue was because the default VLAN 0 on the SRX was set to [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24) and was conflicting with the remote range on the ASA but ive changed this to [192.168.100.0/24](https://192.168.100.0/24) and still no dice.

I have a router connected to a switch which then has two trunks connecting to a pair of Nexus 3k switches.

I’d like to bring up an OSPF neighbor between the router and both Nexus for redundancy but I’m not sure how it will work.

257,t3_garwty,"Hey all,

I have a lab with a couple of servers, which is used to simulate and try out stuff. Networking part of it is basically two used L2 switches (Arista 7124SX and a Cat 3650). It's getting kind of convoluted, with \~20ish VLANs and no inter-VLAN routing at the moment. While this Arista is a L3 switch, this particular box does not support VRF routing (you can configure VRFs and assign interfaces to 'em, but routing between them is not happening). So, in order to tidy things up a bit, I'd like to plop in a VRF-capable L3 device (router on a stick), and spread out my VLANs into appropriate VRFs. Of course, this is a lab thing, so unsupported/EoL devices are okay (until something dies and I get threatening calls about why isn't the lab up, but I'll deal with that when I get there). So, the requirements are:

* Budget dictates it's going to be a used device (500-ish US$/Eur +- 20%)
* VRF-lite capable
* At least 1x10G interface for connecting to the existing topology, two would be excellent
* (Optional) Redundant AC power supplies

What I've been looking at:

* Cat 4948-10G w/ Enterprise services image
* ASR 1000 - way out of my budget from what I've been able to find
* ASR 900 series (920 would be great) - there aren't that many of those to be found used, and the prices are high

  First, I hope you're all safe.. and good job keeping the data flowing through this insanity!  

  I'm an enterprise type network admin, with about 10 years of industry experience and 10 more years before of regular IT related experience.  To give an idea of my skill level, most of my work has been with a university LAN/WAN and other similar infrastructure, and I've stood up a couple BGP routers (with a lot of help from other engineers at partnering organizations).  I can code, and if I get in a groove sometimes it's decent code.

  The reason I'm posting here, is I'm not sure what I should be looking for?  Is there a type of position that would benefit from a decent skill set in networking, and something that would allow growth of a programming skill set?  

  The end goal is to find a position that is 100% remote, with the ability to take on/schedule work from a pool of uncompleted jobs, and take on as many or few jobs as I like based on my availability.  Does this mystical thing exist, and what is it called?   I've been searching job sites and I just can't seem to find something to fit!

* The above, but on a shared central automation server

I have a high level understanding of SSH/Telnet, NAT/PAT, etc. however I have always worked on the presale aspect of the business and never configured this for production.

In this case, we provide customers access to multiple public IPs so that they can remotely log in to multiple firewalls for configuration before shipping them to the end user location. My question is, for example, instead of using 10 public IPs to configure 10 firewalls, can we use one public IP (for example 10.0.10.10) with multiple ports? 

Ex:

We recently tried to deploy wired dot1x in one of our environments (machine authentication), but some of the clients would not authenticate properly.

We also got it to work by removing the configuration from the client NIC (and keeping the configuration on the dock station NIC) which complicates things since not all clients are using this type of Dock station and it would be near to impossible to keep apart in the GPO Dot1x settings.

Both generals are aware of the strategy they will be using, because in a real world scenario where the generals are the client and the server, the developer creates both.

So, as far as I know, the two general's problem is all about sending acknowledgements to acknowledgements without knowing when to stop, because the one general may not receive the last acknowledgement and won't send his army, because he doesn't know if the other general received the previous one. so instead of stopping, the generals can say that if they manage to maintain an acknowledgement sending rate of approximately one acknowledgement per second for the hour that is one hour before the attack time. I say approximately because if the last acknowledgement is not recieved and the rate is 1 acknowledgement 1.000277778, the generals should still attack. How approximately ? approximately enough for the last acknowledgement to be allowed not to happen, but not enough for the last two to be allowed not to happen. So about a 1 / 3600 seconds tolerance.

Dear Reddit [r/networking](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/) community,

first post, hooray! If I break any rules or am not conforming to the netiquette of this community please accept my apologies.

**TL;DR Do you know a (24/16/8 port) switch with 802.3bt power envelope for each individual port?**

This is question comes after a brainstorming session regarding setting up bold remote (rural) computer classrooms. Because Rural schools have limited access to IT technology and electrical energy.

To tackle the challenge of IT technology a modular low power computer system with custom OS was created by volunteers.

Some information regarding our project can be found by googling"" educaid KUBO toolkit"".

Since setting up these systems in our 2 pilots we have noticed the frustration of the second limitation being affordable and reliable access to energy.

The idea now is to use a PoE switch that can deliver next to data also energy to the low power computer systems. How this switch is going to be powered is another question with another technical background not to be discussed here.

Because the combination of a monitor and the low power computer system consumes an easy 30Watt the 802.3af and 802.3at standards do not make the cut.

802.3bt with its 51W to 60W power envelope will suffice for our project needs (computer systems, monitor, lights, fans,…)

Upon researching the necessary primary building block, being a 802.3bt switch the plethora of vendors and models were reviewed. And here it is where we could use your expertise. From research there are no 24/16/8 port switches that provide the 51-60W power envelope to each port.

Some examples:

Vendor A has a 24 port switch with only 8 ports 802.3bt enabled and the rest is 802.3af.

Vendor B has a 16 port switch which are all 802.3bt but has a total capacity of 300Watt (300 / 16 = 19 Watt per port, not enough)

Because there are so many models and so many vendors, I am wondering if the community knows of a model or a vendor that has a 24/16/8 (we aren’t fussy) port switch which has 802.3bt (50Watt) available power for each port?

292,t3_g9qt28,"Hello y'all,

We are currently looking for a successor to our CISCO stack of 2 full SFP × WS-C3750X-24S-S + C3KX-NM-10G.Our network implements 95+ VLANs, dispatched to 50 or so 2950S and 2950X. The average daily traffic is around 13 TB (terabytes) or 104 Tb (terabit) (90% being IP CCTV).

We'd like to replace this stack by recent and supported hardware that could withstand the current throughput + 50% min. while being as reliable as possible. This equipment centralizes our MAN and interconnects our buildings up to 3 Miles / 5 Km of distance (read SPOF).

I plan to ask an integrator to assist us in the transition process but first things first, I'd like to know what you think.

So, which family of Cisco hardware would you recommend for a 1-to-1 replacement?

Since we are not using any advanced features on the switches or software to manage them, we are wondering whether we should look after some Mikrotik switches for this usage. Would you consider this brand or is this a no-go for a core equipment?

Your guidance and advice will be much appreciated by my team and myself.

We're looking to add 10Gbe capability to our half rack and I was hoping for some recommendations for a pair of Top of Rack switches.

We have a half rack at a colocation facility, with 4 hypervisors, 1 NAS with 4 x 1Gbe RJ45, a new NAS with 6 x SFP+ 10Gbe ports, and a pfsense XG-7100 appliance with 2 SFP+ 10Gbe ports.

Each hypervisor has 4 x 1Gbe ports, and we intend to buy SFP+ 10Gbe PCIe cards for the hypervisors, at least 2 ports per hypervisor.

Our current switches are 48 port RJ45 1Gbe Cisco 2960-S switches stacked.  The model we have has 4 x SFP 1Gbe uplink ports, so we don't have any SFP+ 10Gbe switch ports.

We don't need fancy features but L3 capability is a must (we'd like to be able to give the switch an IP on each VLAN) and we'd like to have 2 switches for redundancy.  The assumption is all recommendations have some link aggregation, DHCP relay / proxy.

Our intent is to continue using the Cisco switches for a little while as we won't be able to get into the colo to rewire everything.  So what we want are switches with plenty of SFP+ 10G and 1Gbe ports.

I'm also curious as I read that some switches support both 10G/25G.  Are such SFP ports compatible with adapters that only support SFP+ 10Gbe?

I've been researching using spanning tree for redundancy, but I'm not really sure how that works.

Basically I want it to work like this:
1) Use the fiber lag always if the link is up.
2) If one fiber link goes down, the LAG will still be up, we'll just operate at 10gig instead of 20gig.

I have done a packet capture in wireshark and I see that every single traffic leaving the router (R3) is having  the QoS value ""Precedence 4""  


But packets going through the VTI tunnel interface also have ""precedence 4"" QoS markings (But it supposed to be having ""precedence 2"" markings.  


As soon as I give out:  
**interface ethernet1/0**  
**no service-policy output Physical-MAP**  
 **exit**

So basicly removing the physical policy, traffic going through the VTI tunnel instantly turns into ""precedence 2"" marked QoS values.  


But for some reason, if both policies are applied the physical interface policy simply overwrites the VTI tunnel policy.

I read reddit all the time for help on issues, but I rarely post, but I'm at a stopping point.  I really need help and google/reddit/everything else aren't doing anything.

A couple of years ago I migrated our corporate environment from an ASA 5510 to a Cisco Firepower 2110 with FMC.  We've always used Anyconnect as the client obviously.  I run a couple of Mac's, (and am the only user in the company that does, the rest of my IT Team use Windows), and Anyconnect has run flawlessly for years.  Yesterday, during the middle of a VMware migration, (we setup a new VMware cluster and installation and I was migrating all the VM's from the old hosts to the new), I plugged my Macbook into my wired connection and my connection through the VPN went screwy.  I all of a sudden could not access my ILO screen's, the VMware host screen's or any other intranet site at work, (FMC, Cisco Wireless Controller, Sharepoint, our time and attendance, etc).  Regular internet traffic was still working.  Obviously, I checked the status of the Anyconnect client, (it had reconnected).

I began really testing this, so, as stated above I connect with IP addresses, not hostnames for VMware, so, I assumed this was not a DNS issue, but still tested that.  I can ping everything, via IP address or hostname.  It all works.  I can RDP across Anyconnect, (which is how I finished the migration btw), I can telnet and SSH to all devices, including my VMware ESX systems.  I can browse to the intranet to a non port 80 or 443 address through a web-browser, (i.e. the vSphere Server Appliance configuration page is at [https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5480](https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5480) and that works flawlessly).

So, everything works, except port 80 and 443 from ANY WEB BROWSER.  I tried Safari, Edge Chromium, Google Chrome, Firefox, I even installed Tor and that didn't work.  

If I do a portscan on one of my devices, 80 and 443 show as open.

If I run my windows 10 VM on Parallels, and connect through the Anyconnect VPN, it works fine.  My other Mac works fine, this is clearly a problem with my primary Mac only.

Things I have done:

A) Create a new location in network preferences

B) Checked the routing tables, (though, everything else works, why would this not be right?)

C) Delete and re-add Wifi

D) Delete NetworkInterfaces.plist, com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist,   
com.apple.airport.preference.plist, preferences.plist

E) Uninstall and re-install Anyconnect.  Also, remove the Anyconnect configuration files, and profile   
files.  I have tried various versions of this step over and over.

F) Rebooted a million times

G) Googled.  Alot.

Again the action that caused this was simply plugging an ethernet cable in while I was connected to the VPN over WiFi.  

Any suggestions?

My good friend and fellow Network Admin/Manager suggested I wipe and start over with the Mac.  Well, with the whole work from home thing, my time machine backups are not current.

However, it seems to me that if you're using top-of-rack switches in the access layer, the L1 infrastructure required would get a bit out of control...

If we're looking at a medium-to-large sized DC, wouldn't it make more sense to design a 3-tier model where every TOR switch connects to 2+ EOR switches, and then those EOR switches connect to all the core switches in the Clos Fabric? You could still scale-out at the access layer installing additional EOR switches if needed.

If what I'm saying DOES make sense, then why isn't this sort of design commonly depicted? I mean, I know not every deployment will use managed TOR switches; some will have EOR only, others will have FEX (though isn't Cisco sunsetting it?), but my impression has always been that TOR tends to be the preferred design choice these days, at least in pods where do you don't have a bunch of large blade servers.",Top-of-Rack Access in Spine-Leaf DC designs,r/networking,0.69,8,1587909251.0,,,12

I buy transit off AS2, who buys transit off AS3, who peer or buy transit off AS4. Everything is simple, my routes are redistributed.

Now I bring up a connection to an IX and peer with the route servers. AS3 is already a member of this IX.

    +-----+         +-----+         +-----+         +-----+
    | AS1 +---------+ AS2 +---------+ AS3 +---------+ AS4 |

       +-------------+ IX +------------+
                     +----+

AS3 now learns my routes from the IX with a shorter AS path, and if they accept them it would mean I get 10gbps to AS4 rather than the 100mbps I'm paying for. This obviously isn't the case, but I want to understand what they're doing to mitigate this.

If AS3 had a manually managed list of routes that they were meant to be accepting from AS2, and say marked them with a community string when they learned them, then redistributed to AS4 based off that community string - The route that's now in their RIB is learned from the IX and does not have that string attached, so the moment the IX route lands in their RIB they'll stop redistributing the prefix to AS4. 

If they did this redistribution based off manually/API managed prefix lists egress to AS4, and my route was on that list, then they would redistribute my IX route and I would end up with 10gbps of bandwidth to AS4, when I'm only paying for 100mbps of transit to AS2 who also only pays for 100mbps of transit to AS3.

The only conclusion I've been able to come to is that AS3 must simply set a higher local preference for routes learned from paying customers. But that almost seems too simple, and doesn't cover off another issue;

Say I advertsied a /22 into transit and /24s into the IX. AS3 now redistributes the /22 it learns from AS2 to AS4, but when traffic reaches AS3 it would surely follow the more specific /24 routes to me via the IX.

Would AS3 filter the routes they learn from any downstream peering/IX, rejecting all prefixes and contained prefixes that customers (like AS2) are paying them to redistribute?",Transit provider route redistribution and IX peering,r/networking,0.75,9,1587799990.0,,,24

So, within my EVPN fabric HMM works just fine, the VM pops up on a new VTEP the old MAC route is removed and the new one is added and traffic flows just fine. I'm having a problem regarding a VIP attached to 2 different hosts, HostA and HostB. HostA is in DC1 and HostB is in DC2.

HostA has an IP of [10.1.1.101](https://10.1.1.101) a MAC of 0000.1111.2222, HostB has an IP of [10.1.1.102](https://10.1.1.102) a MAC of 0000.2222.3333. The VIP is [10.1.1.100](https://10.1.1.100). When the VIP moves between hosts the l2vpn route gets added, but the old one stays in the BGP table. This makes sense since it's a different MAC address, but because of this the traffic to that VIP gets blackholed in the site that no longer has that VIP. That site still thinks that the route is local, and will continue to think that until it's finally removed from the BGP route table. I think that happens when the ARP entry times out on the old VTEP, but I'm not certain.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having trouble exporting the list of prefilter rules from my FMC 6.4.0. I realize after researching that this can't be done either from the GUI or through an API call in version 6.4. So my only option is the CLI. In the CLI on the FMC I get a bash shell, and at the root directory I do a find . -iname prefilter\* which returns a bunch of useless lib files and the likes, nothing that would help. As for the FTD device that hs the prefilter rules applied to it, that is just useless, I only get a rudimentary CLI, and when I do connect FXOS, can't seem to do much in there either. There is no 'expert' mode as some online results suggested. I am stumped at the moment, and frankly feel frustrated by this Cisco spaghetti mess. Can anyone help please.

When you try to poll the DDM from them, both Tx- and Rx-power always reported 8.16 dBm. Seeing as they worked, and the next batch didn't have the problem we acknowledged the problem with the vendor and then promptly forgot about the problem.

Today while discussing some troubleshooting steps with a couple of new hires this problem was mentioned by them. I casually dismissed the problem with ""it's a hardware bug, don't worry about it! It's probably a translation-issue inside of the plug"".

After this I went over a conversion-table from mW to dBm, and noticed this:

    6 mW = 7.7815 dBm
    7 mW = 8.4510 dBm

I then wondered what 8.16 dBm maps against in mW:

    8.16 dBm = 6.5463 mW

That's awfully close to 2^16 so i translated that into dBm:

    6.5536 mW = 8.1647 dBm

So, I need to add a G0/0/3 - VPN0 that connects back into the LAN and can listen for TLOC from the metro-ethernet.

But this is where I am lost.

The picture I have with the hybrid is close to what I am trying to do, but not exact.   On that one, they have VPN0's reversed for what I am trying to do.  I already have legacy on G0/0/1.

356,t3_g70bnc,"Hello,

Here is my scenario...

We have a medium sized private data center, this site is connected to the internet through a single ISP provider. This ISP gives us a block of IPs we use to publish various services to the internet (Exchange, Lync, VPN, Citrix, and our LOB applications).

**Couple of internet outages go by and I am now pressed to find a redundant solution so that our site does not go dark when our ISP has an issue.**

Searching around I keep ending up at SD-WAN solutions ([bigleaf.net](https://bigleaf.net), [aryaka.com](https://aryaka.com), [zscalar.com](https://zscalar.com) [catonetworks.com](https://catonetworks.com), etc..) but I know very little about SD-WAN and it seems to be there are different types of SD-WAN providers (on-premise, cloud, backbone etc.).

I can get internet services from a 2nd ISP provider so that we have **redundant ISP providers**, this would ensure the last mile is also redundant and protect us against local line cuts.

I would need to be able to ""bond"" both ISPs together in a fail-over configuration and it seems SD-WAN can do this for **outbound** traffic.

**What I can't wrap my head around is how the IP addressing is handled. If I have 2 different ISPs and 2 different set of IP addresses, how is the IP switching handled?**

For example if Exchange's autodiscover DNS records are configured to resolve to IP from primary ISP, the secondary ISP IPs will be different. How can Exchange continue to work? This is just one example of the many other apps users need access to by IP or DNS.

I did came across BigLeaf ([https://www.bigleaf.net/same-ip-address-failover/](https://www.bigleaf.net/same-ip-address-failover/))  and they market themselves as a SD-WAN provider, and on that page it seems to provide a solution to the exactly problem we are trying to solve.

*Because with Bigleaf, when one of your Internet circuits has an outage, you don’t. Your IP address doesn’t change. Your VPN, remote desktop session, SSH session, VoIP call, Web Presentation, and every other application stays up!*

So it sounds to be that some SD-WAN providers are able to provide a solution to our question.

Anyone have experience using SD-WAN solutions to provide both inbound and outbound fail-over and address our ""same-ip-address-failover"" requirement? I would like to come up with a short list of providers to reach out to for further discussions etc.

In case anyone suggests, I know we can keep the TTL on our critical DNS records low and update the IP addresses in case of outage, but this is not what we want. Looking for an automated and seamless solution.

Thanks for your help.

I mean, I've done troubleshooting and small projects in DC environments, but I've never actually re-engineered one or stood one up from scratch. With this in mind, I've worked for 3 companies and each of them had data centers that looked like this: 

* Corporate LAN &amp; WAN connect directly to the DC core.
* Most VLANs are open and reside on the Core.
* Stateless ACLs are sometimes applied for certain environments at the VLAN-interface level.
* Everything public-facing is put into a DMZ with its own switches &amp; hosts, with all VLANs being trunked up to an NGFW at the internet edge.

It seems to me that the idea of putting only public services into a DMZ while leaving everything else more-or-less open on the internal network is, well, a bit antiquated. After all, internal users &amp; devices can be malicious too. With this in mind, are we at the point where it makes sense to abandon the traditional DMZ concept and, instead, segment the entire data center from the rest of the corporate network?

I’m a Network Architect with about six years programming experience.  I’m currently learning Angular frontend web framework and I have experience with developing backend (API/scripts etc.).  My process of learning is to build something useful in parallel to learning the theory.  

Anyway, I decided to focus on the theme of BGP/Internet routing/security since it’s a hot topic.  I have a few ideas of my own, but I would love to get some suggestions about useful features I can incorporate.

Currently I’ve got:
- Summary of current status for a given ASN (including prefixes, advertisement status, neighboring ASNs/upstream providers)
- Live/recent BGP events for a given AS or prefixes
- Detection/alerting of BGP route hijacking/invalid advertisements and other incidents
- Auditing/compliance report, with a focus on security

There are some really good websites out there already, like ripe.net that present extensive information. I’m hoping to obtain suggestions about issues or challenges that are not already covered so I am simply not reinventing the wheel with this project.

382,t3_g69udu,"For the unfortunate souls who have to be working on FTD...

Recently found myself in the position of needing to get a pcap I did on the CLI of a Customer FTD to prove to a vendor that we were forwarding traffic to them and realized after doing the capture and being able to see it in the CLI I wasn't familiar with how to actually download it off the FTD as a pcap file.

Granted I know you can do a capture from the FMC via Advanced Troubleshooting, but it's quick and painless when you're already in the CLI troubleshooting to run a quick capture with the capture command.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus ensues the struggle of Google-Fu and while I was able to find most related commands I had no luck:

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. ""Do this and you'll be good"":

*&gt;copy /pcap capture:&lt;capture\_name&gt;* *ftp://user:password@server/directory* 

&amp;#x200B;

Well nope... doesn't work. Get to ""copy /pcap capture:&lt;capture\_name&gt;"" and can't type any further and it's mad. Why it took a TAC case and not the below showing up in an easy to find Google search is beyond me.

&amp;#x200B;

The real trick of hopping into the ""REAL"" CLI (aka the ASA CLI) and now suddenly we have progress:

*&gt;system support diagnostic-cli*

*&gt;copy /pcap capture:&lt;capture\_name&gt; disk0:*

&amp;#x200B;

Works like a charm! So now to go get the file. Hop into expert mode, sudo up, get into the disk0 directory and move it to the /ngfw/var/common/ directory:

&amp;#x200B;

*&gt;expert*

*&gt;sudo -i*

*&gt;cd cisco/applications/*

*&gt;cd &lt;cisco-ftd.x.x.x.x.\_\_ftd\_\_\_SERIAL####&gt;*

*&gt;cd app\_data/disk0*

*&gt;cp &lt;capture\_name&gt; /ngfw/var/common/*

&amp;#x200B;

Now in FMC, go to the 'Troubleshoot' button for the FTD in question, then 'Advanced Troubleshooting' and the first tab 'File Download' you can type in the filename of the capture to download. It's looking at the /ngfw/var/common/ directory so you only need &lt;filename&gt; not /ngfw/var/common/&lt;filename&gt;

(quick overview of network)

  
2 WAN lines from a main and backup ISP run into a Fortigate80E firewall. The firewall is directly connected to a  UBNT gigabit layer 3 EdgeSwitch 48-Port EdgeSwitch which handles core switching and does have L3 capabilities. This switch then connects out to 11 smaller access switches that go out to banks of desks. The company has roughly 150 users atm and will reach 200 by the end of the year. There are no on prem servers and almost all traffic will be voip, web browsing and accessing files off cloud storage. We also have about 10 unifi pro AP's and 2 cloud keys that manage wireless networking. 

  
My manager has requested I look into replacing our current Fortigate80E firewall with an offering from Ubiquiti. (The current firewall isn't under enormous stress, this is more for future-proofing project and hopefully being able to centralise management around a ubiquiti console)

  
My first thought is seemingly the most powerful firewall offering from Ubiquiti is the USG Pro 4? However, from what I have read it doesn't seem more capable than a Fortigate 80E? maybe more of a sidestep, besides the obvious advantage of centralized management with the current switch and ap's.  
I was also thinking for a company of this size, surely it would be better to have a separate firewall and router to deal with core routing. Perhaps a USG Pro as the firewall and maybe another Ubiquiti router to handle the majority of internal routing??

403,t3_g5odss,"Hello, fellow networking admins and engineers,  

I have a stumper of a situation that we have had for a year or so now since we rolled out Windows 10 to everyone.  The symptoms we see are users in remote offices are reauthenticating repeatedly over and over with our Network Access and Control system (Cisco ISE using Aruba RAP-109 WAPs).  The logs in ISE say ""supplicant stopped responding to ISE.""  We also had Aruba's ClearPass authentication server (a direct competitor of Cisco ISE) being used and it had the same problems as well.  

This issue has gone on for over a year with ARUBA, CISCO, and MICROSOFT TAC teams being involved with none of them finding anything wrong or anything to show them from the infrastructure/client-side.  This is still happening and today we received a trouble ticket from a site that has operated fine for years saying ""All the users in the office are having problems connecting to the Wi-Fi (which actually translated into only one user is sitting in the office....am I right? - I was right). But none the less, this typically happens randomly and affects most if not all of the entire office.  We have swapped out laptops, we have swapped out access points.   we have upgraded, downgraded just about everything on the infrastructure side with no new results and the problem continues. 

So I got to thinking, a commonality I found (so far) is these sites having issues are all multi-tenant buildings.  That led me to think, hey - there might be other corporate Wi-Fi systems in the area that are ""de-authenticating"" our clients from our Wi-Fi network. When a trouble ticket was reported, we always found a fair amount of SSIDs around that can be seen from the user's laptop.  I'm guessing maybe they have a wIPS solution running and think we have unauthorized endpoints trying to connect to rogue WAPs.  Just grasping at straws on this one.  And this theory doesn't support the fact that this issue became very noticeable when all the windows 10 clients were being issued out and were never seen on the windows 7 clients. But I'm still latched onto the wIPS de-authentication possibility because that bought us some time with management harping at us with status and progress updates and seemed to calm them down just a tad when I threw this scenario at them as a possibility we need to investigate.    I also thew out solar flares and EMP mishaps occurring nearby.  Nobody bought it.  

The guys managing the laptops are blaming the network (of course).  We tell them that we can't force the laptop to stop its 802.1x authentication process midstream.  Cisco, Aruba, and MICROSOFT can't find anything.  We don't have any tools or technical staff at the remote sites and since the devices can't connect to the network, we can't troubleshoot.  We did put these trouble sites into monitor only mode within the ISE appliances so they can connect.  We still see NAC/802.1X auth failing, but at least they can do some work and connect with the network until InfoSec says to turn it back on and fix whatever it is causing NAC to fail.

I just wanted to share this scenario with everyone to see if anyone else has any similar experiences or guidance on the topic.  Everyone likes a good challenge and this has been the best one yet, at least for our networking team.

I need to add a router to existing subnets that will provide failover between 2 ISPs with floating routes and IP SLA.

However reading over best practices I don't actually see a lot of information on the best method to do this... Rather don't mix applications with pre-defined categories. 

EG: Dropbox AND ""file storage/sharing"" 

Our rule base grew to cumbersome thus causing it to go on the fritz and in some cases inspect bypass objects or not get inspected when it should have. (Still happened with R80.30)

I am looking for a functionality in tcp for a situation and the explanation goes as follows.


Let us say there are 2 hosts H1 and H2.

H1 sends 20 packets P1 P2 ... P20 to H2 in 20 milliseconds but due to some issues in the medium P3 was dropped. Due to congestion H2 was not able to send timely acks and H1 waited till its timeout of 1 second to resend a segment containing P3 and once that new retransmitted packet containing P3 was received by H2 all old packets upto P20 were actually processes by H2.


The issue here is that H2 processes data delayed by 1 second due to inherent properties of tcp stack. I wish to not let this happen because 1 sec is just way too much of a delay for me and I want H2 to somehow ignore all packets from P3 to P20. Is there any way I can make this happen?

429,t3_g51lna,"Hi all,

I am trying to wrap my head around certificate authentication.

I have a Cisco Anyconnect VPN setup using IKEv2, AAA and certificate setup as authentication method.

Device certificate on OUTSIDE interface is by 3rd party trusted cert authority and I have their identity certificate, and couple of root CA’s under CA Certificates in ASA.

Internal PKI infrastructure and its root ca is loaded under CA Certificates which is used for user cert validation. Users have user certs install on their laptops from internal PKI.

In the scenario above if user present’s 3rd party trusted user cert could they successfully pass validation?

Is there a way to specify which trustpoint is used for certificate validation?

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

the solution to the problem is to add **no validation-usage** to the trustpoint.

You can also do this from ASDM by editing the cert under CA Certificates and under advanced deselect validation usage options.

Look up validation option in the document below

433,t3_g4y4qe,"Hi /r/networking,

Just returned from a small business site that I have recently just taken on. Unfortunately, not much was handed over in terms of setup information so today has been much of an information gathering exercise. The reason I have been called out is they currently have no internet access. This wasn't an issue until it was 3 weeks ago. As far as I am aware, nothing was changed. They have quite a basic L3 setup as follows:

Core Switch &lt;---&gt; Lightspeed Filtering System &lt;---&gt; Cisco ASA &lt;---&gt; Cisco Router &lt;---&gt; Internet

I have been informed that Lightspeed system was never set up when installed so pretty much a redundant box that resides in the cabinet at the moment. NAT is carried out on the Cisco ASA. The internal IP address scheme is 10.1.20.0/24 with the inside interface on the Cisco ASA set on Gig1/8 to 10.1.20.254. The outside scheme is ""showing"" as 192.168.1.0/24 (I say ""showing"" as I don't think this is correct but I will get to that) with the Gig1/1 interface on the Cisco ASA set to outside with the IP address as 192.168.1.1. Now, I only have administrative control up until the Cisco ASA as the Cisco router was provided and is administered by BT Business, apparently. I have no details for this and no management access without doing a full factory reset. The site has two physical hosts that contain two virtual DC's that provision DNS, DHCP etc. They have four switches that are trunked via fiber to give a 10GbE backbone. I have thoroughly tested the internal network on a multitude of ports just as a precaution and to completely rule it out and devices are getting valid internal IP addresses and can inter-communicate.  I think this was apparent from the get go and the problem lies outside the internal network. Gave BT a call to make sure they had no issues on their end which they confirmed (typical). 

Now, this brings me to the NAT setup, which I believe is what is causing the issue. Fortunately, due to lockdown, only 2 members of staff are present on site that require internet access so as a temporary workaround, I have patched them into a few of the spare ports directly on the Cisco router which I CAN get internet access but only on the 192.168.*.* range, so at the moment they can't access anything internally but they are fine with that for now as they just need access to emails and internet based communication tools. This is where I think the potential problem lies. As I was patching these devices in, I assume the Cisco router is handling DHCP which is giving out a 192.168.128.0/24 address scheme which does not reside within the same subnet as what is set on Cisco ASA outside interface, with an IP 192.168.1.1. My question would be, would it be just a case of setting the outside interface on the Cisco ASA to an IP that resides within the 192.168.128.0/24 range, presumably 192.168.128.1 then set up a static route so that the two devices can communicate? Like I said, as I have no control over the Cisco router, I am going to give BT a call again to see if any changes were made and if I can obtain access to it, if possible. 

I have to admit, I do have a basic level of networking, currently working on CCNE with the hope of moving onto a CCNA and CCNP, so happy to learn and scour for information on any advice given. Just wanted to confirm if I had the right train of thought and am heading in the right direction with my diagnoses. Is there anything that I can potentially check or anything that I might of missed?

442,t3_g4qdns,"Good day everybody. 

This one is long.
TL;DR - I am redoing the Wi-Fi at my work, currently there is home routers acting as access points all joined together with 100 down and 6 Modem providing it all. Looking for input how to replace it equipment that can handle the load of 300+ people at peak times. 

I was going back and forth between homenetworking and networking to make sure I am in the correct sub but with how big my setup has to be I assume I would end up in this one. I will try to include as much info as possible. 

I have dabbled with enterprise gear for my home lab but haven’t done a full setup for a commercial environment before. 

My situation - I am in the navy stationed in guam and I have been designated for redoing the public Wi-Fi through out certain locations in the ship. There is roughly 300 users that will be on it during the peak hours. 

How it is setup currently (You might chuckle a bit):

It starts with a 100 Down 6 Up Cable modem (Highest speed offered on the island) with a Linksys EA9400 Home Router that has two Cat 5E Cables coming out of the LAN Ports. This is in a public office space and Game Room. This sees about 35 people max. 

The first CAT 5E cable goes from that router to a AC1700 TP-Link C20 home router in the gym a level below. This space sees about 25 People max

The second CAT5E cable makes a long 400+ feet run to a large eating area (Mess Decks) where roughly 250 people at one time can sit and eat. That cable plugs into another AC1700 TP-Link C20. That router in the eating area then has three more CAT5E cables from it.

The first cable runs another home C20 Router in a Lounge area. About 20 people will be in the space. The second cables goes to a Linksys EA7300 and that is in a officer eating area (Ward Room). This one will be going away soon since the officers are going to get a second modem for themselves. The third cable goes to nowhere and is assumed dead. (Tracking it down tomorrow) 

To top it off, there is a random Wi-Fi booster attached to router in the public eating area (Mess Decks). No idea who is using it. 

So my plan is to start from scratch. Whatever purchase plan for equipment will have to be presented to my commanding officer to get approval for purchase.

Since this will be a Wi-Fi only network, I will be relocating the Modem, Router, and Switch to help get even distribution of the new Ethernet cable.

As for new equipment, I was considering a Ubiquiti setup. I just trying to plan for when I detach from this ship and future growth for the network. 

Edgerouter X (ER-X-US)
Unifi Switch 8 60Watt (US-8-60W)
5x AP-AC Lite (UAP-AC-LITE) 

Every public space will get 1 AP with the large eating area 2. One for each side of the room. 

I hope I didn’t cause too much a headache asking for help. I am no means a professional and my local IT’s are just providing new cable and tools since most don’t know as much as myself (I am mechanic at work, Nerd at home)

457,t3_g48tgz,"I am looking for recommendations for a modern, real time networking monitoring system and platform. 

Today, most of our devices still only speak SNMP, which is by no means a modern nor real time monitoring protocol. Most NMS only support 5 minute polling, while some support 1 minute polling intervals. I am looking for something that can do at least per minute polling.  

These devices also respond to ICMP ping requests. Most of these machines can respond to a ping per second, so graphing this data would be beneficial. Not sure per second pings would cause a spike in traffic or cpu resources.

Overtime, more and more of our networking equipment will support some sort of streaming telemetry.Today, we have both Juniper and Cisco devices that support streaming telemetry. Juniper supports streaming with their Junos Telemetry Interface (JTI). Cisco has their Model-Driven Telemetry. I cannot find many NMS that seem to support either of these protocols. 

The last metric we would like to monitor is flows. Our Juniper devices support IPFIX and many of our switches support sFLOW. I am not sure that the default flow interval is on most of these type of devices, but I assume it's per second type of reporting?

I assume most will just recommend we use some sort of opensouce system, and make our own. The TICK stack, ELK, and prometheus come to mind. This seems to be the default option, especially for the streaming telemetry use case. 

However, we really don’t have an interest in rolling our own. I like the look of Grafana and Kibanna for visualizations, but sorting through thousands of MIBs, OIDs, streaming telemetry events, and other data, and then creating our own dashboards sounds like a ton of work. 

We are looking for something that we can buy or implement that is fairly straightforward, and ideally built on these modern time series database technologies. Something that already has all the MIBs and OIDs, dashboards built, and hard work done. 

Solarwinds and PRTG seems like popular NMS providers. We reached out to both of them, and they both don’t even have streaming telemetry on their roadmap?

458,t3_g458mb,"Started at 9PM last night. Tore down BGP config, which was 2 routers each linked to ISP A and ISP B. Rebuilt minus old spaghetti, and with a third ISP C. Peering worked. Was very happy.

But a couple devices are down. One is a vendor VPN box. Another is Cisco expressway VM. Both do not have public IPs, but have VIPs on a fortigate firewall. Expressway is acting like it has no internet at all. I can see the ping/DNS attempts on the fortigate- traffic goes out but doesn't come back. Not being blocked, just not getting return traffic on the firewall.

Which would suggest a routing problem, except the rest of the network is fine. That being said the routing was coming in asymmetrically, so I shut ISP C. Now we are back to ISP A and B, but I'm only using A right now to keep it simple. Both of above devices are still not connecting.

I suspect 1) ISP issue with inbound traffic. This is basically confirmed. But it doesn't explain the VPN box and expressway. For that I suspect 2) fortigate issue, or the IPS on the inside interface of it.

460,t3_g43tpo,"Hello

I am currently working on a script to replace ACLs on Cisco IOS/IOS-XE routers. Atomic config changes beyond a single line and netconf candidate configs are not a thing on the firmwares of many of the devices that I have to work with.

My assumptions are:

- Someday someone, who doesn't know what the script does exactly, will try to do replace an ACL on all of our routers and the script should not fuck up everything unless the other assumptions are met.
- The ACL that needs to be changed might be somewhere where it might influence my ability to log in. e.g. it is the ACL on the interface over which I am logging in or it might be the ACL used for the SSH access.
- If the old ACL allows me to login in then the new one will also allow this.
- Errors need to be recoverable, e.g. if I lose the connection for whatever reason I can run the script again and bring everything into the desired state.

Here are some Ideas that I had, which do not work:

- resequence the old ACL so that there is enough ""space"" for the new one entries to be inserted before the old entries. Then delete the old entries. This does not work because you can not have the same entry multiple times in an ACL. Also the resequence is only available for legacy IP.

- copy the ACL, change all sections in which that ACL is used to the copy, change the ACL in place, revert the changes to the config so that the new ACL is used. Delete the copy. This has several Problems:
  - How do you know where the ACL is used? There are many more things than interfaces and vtys.
  - Error recovery is a pain in the butt because you have to check if a copy exists, then you have 2 ACLs on the device, one of which might not be complete but you dont know which one that is. Also you might have a config that references both sections. You might be able to resolve some of that, but it will be painfull.

Something else  I thought about was adding the IP from which I am logging in as the first entry to the ACL so that I can not lock me out.
But I have to take a deeper look at some of the usecases of ACLs because if an ACL is used in some kind of inverted fashion that might also lock me out.

Trying to do RPKI validation properly on my network. Thought I was fully compliant, but with Cloudflares new testing tool, discovered I'm missing something here and not sure how to work around it.

https://i.imgur.com/tlvxG9p.png

On my ASR9001, its default table is just internet, I manage it fully with OOB interface. It has rpki servers configured to communicate out the management interface, but populates the data properly into the BGP table. I then have it signal via iBGP to the neighboring 9006.

On the 9006, internet is in its own vrf while connecting to transit and peers. It gets the iBGP signals for RPKI from the 9001. However this data appears to only apply to the 9001's routes, not the 9006's, as the 9006's routes show ""not-known"" for RPKI status. I will have ""not-valid"" or ""valid"" next to ""not-known"" on the 9006 due to this for the same netblock.

So I assume what I need is the 9006 connected and talking to my RPKI servers. However with internet in a vrf, this seems impossible as I can only configure rpki-server functions on the default table on its routes (which are all management table routes anyway for private space).

I have two hosts, [172.22.19.48](https://172.22.19.48) &amp; [172.22.19.176](https://172.22.19.176) (behind closest routers Gi0/1 interface) , These are the only hosts that are allowed to reach an FTP server ([172.25.30.15](https://172.25.30.15)) two routers away.

On the closest router to the source, I'm using an extended ACL.

The goal is to allow only those two hosts access to the FTP while their entire subnet can access the DNS server (172.22.23.39)

`(config)# ip access-list extended MultiHosts`

`(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp` [`172.22.19.48`](https://172.22.19.48) [`0.0.0.128`](https://0.0.0.128) `host` [`172.25.30.15`](https://172.25.30.15) `eq 21`

I'll be performing my first collapsed core shutdown in my career. It's a hybrid campus and datacenter mix in a small/mid environment with netapp, ucs, vmware stack.. I wanted to reach out to see what advice the community would recommend on things/issues to watch out for during a shutdown while replacing the  L2/L3 core and start up. Leaning on the experience of the community would really help me out me a lot, especially while the network is so critical during a COVID-19 world we live in today.

I'm the only senior member of my team with the knowledge of all systems to be able to perform this maintenance window and I don't have a change control and/or peer review partner to lean on at the moment with some of my team/head counts not being filled at the moment which has put a lot of workload on me, which to be honest made me learn a lot from improving my storage, virtualization, networking, systems, and ansible/automation skills to be able to support a datacenter/campus.

I'll be replacing  a 6504 VSS stack and nexus 5k distribution with nexus 9K's and reconnecting the access layer and datacenter (UCS  and NetApp) port-channels. These 6504's have been running a bit too long :) with EoL next year glad to replace them and get updated code. At the same time I'll be removing VTP from the switches and re-configuring the VLANs on the access layer (the exact same VLANs trying to minimize changes)

My current plan is as follows in a converged infrastructure in a non-certified ""flexpod""

1. Make sure we have all documentation for IPAM, management addresses, and non-domain/active directory passwords in a location that is accessible while the network is in outage mode and export the password vault system to an encrypted offline file and all SSH private keys. In addition also have TFTP copies of all startup/running configs for all cisco devices, UCS, VMware config export, RVtools export, netapp sysconfig, and palo alto firewalls export.
2. Shutdown all VMware level VMs and domain controllers (hosting DNS, DHCP, and AD).
3. Shut down ESXi Cisco UCS hosts but leave the UCS/FI's running.
4. Leave NetApp cluster (A700 and FAS8200) running.
5. Replace Core l2/l3 network with new Nexus 9k with a logical migration of the configuration (which I""m confident in the most as most of my experience is in networking).
6. Start up ESXi hosts/blades via UCS FI mgmt https once l2/l3 back online which mount NFSv3 to netapp datastores (which haven't been shutoff).
7. Connect to ESXi host mgmt https and start up domain controllers (bring up DNS, DHCP, and AD service) with offline local ESXi admin/password.
8. Once AD/DNS is running bring up the rest of the environment/services and test everything with the whole team.

Thats my rough/high-level playbook. I'll be labeling all fiber/Cat6 mgmt/data ports ahead of time to allow re-patching to be easy, fast, and stress free.

I have a couple of fluke fiber cleaning kits while disconnecting all the SMF/MMF fiber and have extra SMF/MMF patch cords and Ethernet cat6 patch cords as well. At this point I feel like I'm ready and have nothing else to do, so I figured talking to the community would be the best course of action right now.

Extremely gratefull for any feedback, insight, and advice for my plan I've laid out in advance and your experience doing similar work.

Update: Much thanks for all feedback already provided.

For example, let's say the ISP gives us a public IP range of 1.1.1.0/29. ISP's gateway is 1.1.1.1, and the Palo's interface is 1.1.1.5. The Palo's MAC address on that interface is 01:02:03:04:05:06.

1 Why would a device arp the base network address 1.1.1.0?

2. What should a device do when it sees an arp for the base network address?

3.

We have a forescout appliance, that if a host is out of policy automatically puts into a vlan 404. So there is an ip to vlan mismatch with no communication. Well info sec wants to be able to test that the vulnerability has been fixed before putting back on prod. 

Problem is We have static ips on all our printers and desktops. And only have voice vlans at corp and remore locations that have high voicd traffic as normal locations only have 6 or 7 phones.

After discussing with the team, we have come to the conclusion that changing ALL our desktops/printers from a static addresses to DHCP would allow the forescout device be able to communicate with the devices it has put on quarantine, but some caveats have arose.
What needs to be tested:

•	Stand up a superscope dhcp for mac binding (every printer and desktop gets the same ip back when goes from prod to Quarantine back to prod) 

•	Would need to create a voice vlan at every branch so when the forscout puts the device on vlan 404, associates are still able to call into tech support. 

•	Need to verify that once a port is changes vlans that the port does an automatic shut/no shut without manual intervention 

^ the last one is what my main question is about but any suggestions over all would help. When a port on a cisco switch changes a vlan does it shut/no shut... So if it dhcp bound it gets put back on the right ip to vlan mapping. Ie no manual intervention at all

From Control plane perspective, BGP has to import routes to the VRF where VxLAN-EVPN tunnel is being terminated, so that a route is available for Data Plane to lookup on the inner header after tunnel termination. Also this will mean that I need to have a VTEP on my Border Node to terminate the tunnel.

From Data Plane perspective, it means that after tunnel termination the packet is sent out with MPLS tag after route lookup on the inner header. The MPLS tag and is derived from L3 lookup on the inner header after tunnel termination.

481,t3_g35qvd,"A client of mine has a 5406 chassis switch that has been happily powering two PoE devices for years. It is equipped with a single ~~275~~875W PSU and two 24-Port GigE PoE blades. We recently started adding additional APs and an IP Camera for a total of five PoE devices and now the switch is throwing *""PD Denied power due to insufficient power allocation""* errors, and all five PoE devices are being randomly dropped off of the network. I mostly see the aforementioned error as the switch itself is powering up, but it also crops up long after bootup too.

At other times, all PoE devices will drop their data link from the network but don't seem to lose PoE. At no time is there a message to indicate why either issue is occurring, just that it has happened. When either problem occurs (either PoE or data), they occur to ALL active PoE ports ONLY - that is to say, non-PoE port members never have issues and if I move PoE devices to another port, the problems follow.

*show power brief* indicates 258W of remaining power, 17W allocated to each port, and each PD actively using less than 5W each (AP datasheet says 8W max, for reference). PoE is disabled on all ports that don't need it and I tried enabling *""no lldp config A1-A24 dot3TlvEnable poeplus_config""* per support's recommendation.

In the logs post-bootup I see each PD come online and request power and followed immediately by the above deny message. Then 5-10 seconds later the PD's will request power again but this time the switch applies power without any complaints. The bigger problem is this process will randomly repeat long after the PoE devices have been operating - could be 30 minutes, could be 48 hours; there's not much consistency in the pattern so far.

Upon playing with the debug lldp and power cycling one of the APs, I see the following:

0001:19:34:45.51 LLDP mlldpCtrl: 8023at: PoeMgr PowerUpdate  to LLDP (mtype = LOC_SYS_CHG) on port A7
0001:19:34:45.51 LLDP mlldpCtrl: 8023at: PowerUpdate values PseAloc=26,PdReq=130 (Type=2, Source=1, Priority=3) on port A7
0001:19:34:45.51 LLDP mlldpCtrl: device status changed : 11

... According to Aruba this indicate that my APs are requesting 130W of PoE power (PdReq=130). Based on that it seems easy enough to blame the Ruckus APs, BUT: I see the exact same request from my HIKVision IP Camera too. It already seems implausible that these old APs would be asking for 130W, but it seems even more unlikely that the switch would be reporting the same issue for a completely different vendor's product. I have also deployed hundreds of these APs before on ProCurve switches and have never seen this before.

My next step is going to be connecting these same PoE devices to a different ProCurve switch to see what it reports - can you all think of anything else I can look at or test or may be missing? It seems unlikely that this is truly a PD or cabling issue but Aruba seems to have their minds made up that this is a Ruckus problem.

We had seen a lot of broadcast traffic coming over a link from our old DR location, there is as MAN between it and the primary. They had not limited the ports to the VLAN chosen to link the two, so each side (due to again bad choices of using the same VLAN numbering) could pass broadcast traffic from one to the other. Once the ports were configured to allow only that VLAN broadcast traffic stopped on that link and my primary site calmed down quite a bit.

So here is my question:

At the ""DR"" site I am seeing ARP floods around every 60 seconds. Wireshark indicates these are all from the Cisco Nexus 9k (9396px). Can anyone think of why the nexus would be doing this in that interval? I have searched and scoured forums looking for what this could be, but due to my own ignorance (I am learning...) I am sure there is something I am missing.

Could it be the arp cache aging timeout?

ARP timeouts are default, 1500 seconds (25 minutes).

487,t3_g31yqc,"**TL;DR:** Dev, not an expert in networking. Trying to simulate really bad WAN connection for benchmarking. I came up with a way how to do it but not completely sure about it. Pls help me verify that my setup makes sense. I am afraid my benchmarking-results won't be meaningful at all if I make any mistake at this stage.

&amp;nbsp;

Hello fellow redditors,

I am a developper trying to create an application that should works well even under bad WAN conditions (High latency, potentially high loss, maybe over VPN, ...). To verify that my application works well enough I tried to build a testing environment where I can simulate different network conditions.

&amp;nbsp;

I read a lot of blog posts on how to do this under Linux. I found out that Linux has a lot of the tools needed already on board (tc and netem). I came up with a setup that consists of three ubuntu VMs (server, client and router) and two virtual networks between them. I made tried to make a drawing ([benchmark-arcitecture.png](https://postimg.cc/8FDHJCNF)) to make my setup clearer for you. I configured the router VM to IP-Forward so client and server can reach each other. To then simulate the network latency/loss/bandwidth I created below script that is executed on the router Ubuntu-VM.
   
    #!/bin/bash
    LATENCY=""50ms""
    JITTER=""10ms""
    JITTER_CORRELATION=""25%""
    LOSS=""0.1%""
    LOSS_CORRELATION=""25%""
    RATE=""10mbit""
   
    sudo tc qdisc del dev enp0s3 root
    sudo tc qdisc del dev enp0s8 root
   
    sudo tc qdisc add dev enp0s3 root handle 1: netem delay $LATENCY $JITTER $JITTER_CORRELATION distribution normal loss $LOSS $LOSS_CORRELATION rate $RATE 
    sudo tc qdisc add dev enp0s8 root handle 1: netem delay $LATENCY $JITTER $JITTER_CORRELATION distribution normal loss $LOSS $LOSS_CORRELATION rate $RATE

The thing I am the most unsure about in this setup are the two `tc`-commands. I built them together from different things I read in several blog-posts. With some trial-and-error i got it all to work. Now I am somewhat afraid that I made some mistake in this setup that would later cause all my benchmarking-results to be not meaningful at all.

&amp;nbsp;

Now here are my questions:

1. Is it really true, that I need the `tc`/`netem` command for both network interfaces (because they only apply to outgoing packages). I am afraid of accidentally adding twice as much network-crappiness as I intend to in this way.

2. Do you think that this approach can work/is any good at simulating realistic bad network conditions?

3. Maybe do you know a better solution how to simulate bad WAN conditions?

4. I already used `ping`, `tracepath` and `iperf3` to try to verify that the connection actually behaves as I am expecting. Do you have any other suggestions how I could verify that my network simulator behaves in a realistic way.

5. Little bit off the original topic: What do you think would be some really bad (but still realistic) network conditions (latency/jitter/loss/bandwith) that I should be using for my testing.

Of course any other suggestions on that topic are very welcome.

489,t3_g30502,"Hi all,

I would like to share with you the adventure I have had the latest 3 weeks in my attempt to perform a firmware upgrade on a pair of Nexus 5596UP switches.

Background: We have 2 nexus 5596UP switches with a L3 card installed and multiple vPCs going through them. No FEX devices, but 3750s are hanging out of those switches, among other things.

Those switches run EIGRP, BGP, IPv6, PIM, MSDP to name a few. They had around \~650 days of uptime and they are both complaining about TCAM Exhaustion among other things. Anyway, we hit a bug that would not prepend AS paths when being redistributed via BGP so i thought i would take the challenge to upgrade them.

I write the change, I take a show run, ver, spanning tree, vpc, license, arp, arp all vrfs, ip route, ip route all vrfs and begin to upgrade switch 2.

I issue the command ""install all kickstart bootflash:///kistart-whatever.bin system bootflash:///whatever.bin &lt;cr&gt;

It does the calculations, tells me that I am running Layer 3 services therefore a downtime HAS to happen and I press ""y"". The switch initiates a reboot. Note that I was doing that remotely, via a remote console server.

I can see in the console that the reboot process has initiated, and then nothing. I wait 5-10-15 minutes and no output from the console. I then decided to physically visit the DC.

Entering the comms room, I can see that the switch is powered on, but no LEDs are blinking besides the PSU and the STAT. No console output. After a couple of power cycles, I called Cisco to raise a P1 case. While waiting for the case to be created, I searched on my phone ""Cisco nexus not booting"".

I came out with FN  64094 - Nexus 5596/UCS FI 6296 - System Fails to Boot After a Power Cycle - Workaround Provided  
 [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/field-notices/640/fn64094.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/field-notices/640/fn64094.html)

I was thinking ""sh\*t"".

TAC entered the WebEx chat and asked me to provide console output. I said there is none. I have already power cycled twice with no luck. I have then pasted the FN URL in the chat. The engineer responds with something like:

""Please give me a minute to read this""

3 minutes later:

""I will send an RMA unit.""

&amp;#x200B;

Note that this was a Saturday in a COVID-19 lock-down! Although a bit stressed, this was the most exciting thing that happened to me in days! I have arranged with the courier, the DC provider and the device came. I then unboxed it, put the current firmware in, tried to copy the whole config (note it does not work and manual intervention is required), and notice that we are missing features due to licensing.

I then decide to label all switchports with the label printer. Power down the faulty switch. Understand how to unrack that beast; remove the ears from the broken one, put them in the RMA, rack the RMA back, plug all the cables in and power it on. Note that all ports are currently in shut state because the config is not fully applied yet.

I save the old switch in the racks somewhere, but I could not save the box since we do not have a cage in that DC, and all the OPs left (it was 22:00 local time). So I put it in a corner somewhere, hoping they do not dispose it.

The next day I am reporting that to my line manager and explaining that I need the license to be installed before finishing config. License came, I have installed it, finished copying and verifying the config and I go physically to the DC. I get there, I do a ""no shut"" on all the ports and so far so good!

The next morning I get some email alerts showing that the switch has crashed overnight due to:

Reason: Reset performed due to component Error

 System version: 7.3(3)N1(1)

 Service: SUNNYVALE ASIC FAILURE

&amp;#x200B;

Sent the tech-support output to Cisco which then dispatched another RMA. Note that this was during the Easter weekend which the device was supposed to be sent on Thursday afternoon, but came Monday at around 21:00. So I raised another emergency change to swap the RMA with another RMA switch.

I am now at the same place I was before the upgrade. I am in the process of raising a change to preemptively patch Switch1 so it does not hit that field notice. After that I will be able to successfully upgrade the 2 switches.

TL:DR. I tried to upgrade the firmware on a Nexus switch, the device crashed, Cisco sent an RMA which crashed the next day and they sent an RMA for their RMA.",My banter of the day. Upgrading Cisco Nexus switch.,r/networking,0.9,88,1587151437.0,,,31

I figure that I'd need a site-to-site VPN (that's also what the OEM told me) but the issue that I see is that we have a hardware firewall at our site but not at the datacenter where the cloud/virtual server would be located.

What would be the simplest/most straight-forward solution to get this working? I know about virtual firewalls but this comes with subscription costs and the need for virtualization. I found some articles describing how to make it work using only Windows Server but I'm not sure if/how this would really work. I'm also open to which hosting provider to use (I know Azure offers a site-to-site solution but I just can't figure out what the whole Azure solution would cost us) if there's someone offering this from the get-go.

When a SIP endpoint is monitored with SIP Options, is there a way to monitor when these endpoints stop responding (i.e. are down) on any equipment?

495,t3_g2vekm,"Hi Guys,

I'm hoping you can shed some light on an issue that  I'm trying to get closure on. I design and install custom home &amp; business automation systems. RTI is my choice product, it interfaces with various TouchPads, handheld remotes, and of course an app.

A command processor is central to all of the devices in the system. This works great with only certain routers. We normally use Ubiquiti and Luxul products, and it's smooth sailing, so we mostly stick to this every chance we get. But sometimes in corporate environments they don't want our equipment on their network for security. In this case, we just need a basic router to handle a few devices.

I believe rti hardware &amp; the app rely on a broadcast from the command processor in order to ""locate"" &amp; communicate. Wireshark shows very regular broadcasts every second or two from the processor. This will work for a few hours between 2 - 12 hrs without issue. Then it just disconnects and the only fix is to reboot the processor and the cycle repeats, some random period later, it's lost again. This happens for sure on netgear, linksys, and of course the crap the cable company hands out.

RTI has some pretty smart people on its team, they only use Luxul and that's as much info they can give on the subject of networking unfortunately. 

Bottom line, I'm curious what the deal is with this! It bothers me that the reason has not surfaced over the 8 years of working with this line of products. Can Broadcast &amp; Multicast break or some service discovery be ignored on certain routers?

496,t3_g2vdrt,"Okay, so a little backstory: I started having some intermittent issues contacting my domain controller. Lots of machines losing their connectivity, logins failing, dropped connections to the file share, etc. One machine went down completely. I set to troubleshooting. We'll call my domain contoso, for the sake of readability, and I'm sure you've all heard the reference.

So, start running tracerts and pings, and just establishing a baseline for my network, which is admittedly janky as a fox, but that's a different (albeit, embarrassing) post.

Everything seems to be resolving, IPs are coming back with replies, etc. Then someone suggests I try nslookup on Amazon, just for kicks. I get a reply, but it isn't what I expected.

""amazon.com.contoso.com"" and an IP that is most definitely not Amazon. I check into it with Firefox, and look into the cert, and it comes back to my media company - let's call them Citycenter.

What happened, here? Did they likely do a web crawl, and find my name and address as the domain registrant, realize it belonged to us, and stick it under their umbrella? Could that be causing my issues? I have machines on my net that return DC.contoso.com as the same funky address as the Amazon lookup. Is that my connectivity issue? I just don't know. The issue is super intermittent, and sometimes the machines work fine, other times I lose my domain trust relationship, but it's hard to see, since my users sit at their desks and run on cached profiles.

For reference, my net is basically all my machines, DC included, tied into a dumb switch, which is tied into my router. Incidentally, wireless connections to the router are not capable of connecting to the domain, guest network or otherwise - but I suspect that's a misconfig on my part I'll address in another post.

Is this my media company's problem? We have our outward web domain, which they manage, so I don't know why they pulled this under their umbrella.

504,t3_g2jqzi,"Hi Network Admins,

Does anyone know if sFlow can be used to monitor VOIP?

Here’s why I ask, and why I think the answer to my question will be “***No.***”  I’ve recently spun up an instance of vFlow, Verizon Digital’s Dockerized sFlow Docker collector.  The image works great, and I highly recommend it.  My boss likes it too, and asked me to think about if we might be able to use vFlow to monitor VOIP calls.

Here’s everything I know about VOIP:

* VOIP uses two protocols: SIP is used for signaling, RTP is used to carry actual voice data.
* When a VOIP call is initiated between two peers, those peer negotiate using SIP (UDP 5060).  In one of those initial “handshake” packets, the peers will communicate, “***You send RTP on UDP 12345, I’ll send RTP back on UDP 12346.***”
* Once that step is completed, all RTP packets for the duration of the call will use only those agreed-upon UDP ports.
* After the call is completed, there is a quick tear-down process, also managed via SIP.

Okay, now imagine Peers A and B are initiating a VOIP call over my sFlow-enabled network.  Here’s what I think happens:

1. Via SIP, peers A and B agree that A will used RTP on UDP 12345 and B will use RTP on UDP 12346.
2. However, sFlow does ***NOT*** sample that key SIP packet containing the previous information.
3. A and B begin their VOIP call and begin transferring a lot of RTP data.
4. sFlow reports a lot of traffic on UDP 12345 and 12346. However, there is no way for sFlow to realize this is VOIP traffic.

Because of the nature of random packet sampling, I’m guessing the above scenario happens almost constantly.  To see a batch of traffic on UDP 12345 and 12346 and then know for sure that that traffic is VOIP, sFlow would need to sample the SIP packet listing the agreed-upon ports, and the SIP packets used to teardown the call later.  What are the odds that those SIP packets will be sampled for every VOIP call?  Practically nil.

I did a bit of Google searching for “sFlow VOIP” but all I see to find are ad websites for professional sFlow products and academic papers.  I’m guessing that this means garden variety sFlow simply can’t monitor VOIP, for the reasons I’ve listed above.

the BT Business Hub 6 is only listed as ""AC Wireless""   


My problem is, on the BH6 I can get upto 1083Mb/s however on the WAP571 the highest it will go is 866Mb/s  


Client is a Galaxy Note8 as this is the fastest wireless device I have, in theory this confirms it has at least a 3x3 mimo antenna array

I cannot figure out for the life of me how to push the WAP571 up-to full rate (at least full rate of my client device), we are getting gigabit internet shortly so I'd like as much wireless throughput as possible.

523,t3_g1v4rm,"Howdy,

I am trying to get an understanding of the best (most common, best practice) way to accomplish this.  We want to have an internal core Router1 (C9500) at a DC1 and an internal core Router2 (4500-X) at DC2.  They will share certain interface VLANs using HSRP (which is not setup yet).  These HSRP'd VLANs would primarily be for the virtualization network.  Currently these routers are using EIGRP to communicate with each other via an etherchannel bundle.

Since we use EIGRP to route between these two cores, I would assume that across these same physical links that we would need to L2 span these HSRP VLANs.  Is this all that we would have to do to get this working?

The main goal is to be able to swing VMs between each DC without having to re-ip the VM.

526,t3_g1rncd,"One day I was randomly looking at our arp tables and CDP/LLDP neighbors. Mostly hoping to find whatever needs upgrading. And then it stuck out, a horrendously outdated AP. Has not been updated since 2011. This was even before the guys that were at my company before me.

It was not pingable, all ports were closed and it was only visible via CDP and only on other devices that were close by. None of my passwords worked. The hostname was a very descriptive 'Router 1'.

Worst of all this device defied everything on how we usually configure devices and several of our policies. I just had to go down that rabbit hole.

Well, I start tracking down its mac address in arp tables until I come to a Linksys. A Linksys SPS enterprise switch. Anyone remember those before they were absorbed into Ciscos SBS lineup? And there it was, an interface with a description containing the customers name.

I ask my boss/CEO whether he knows anything about them and he is like, who are they? Then we ask accounting if they are still paying us. Turns out yes they are and their payments are very regular. Exemplary even. My boss is actually pretty nice most of the time so I don't mind(and usually des not make mistakes like these).

Nothing, I call the client and ask to get an IT person which I eventually get. I ask him to reset our password(luckily he had an admin account as well on the device) and we arrange an appointment for my visit to them so I can upgrade that old beast. Turns out they have been trying to contact us as well on our old contacts.

Eventually  the date came and it was a 2 hour job stepping it trough updates and being careful that nothing breaks. Luckily everything worked out fine. I enabled remote management, did some cleanups and everything was just fine.

I thought that application whose traffic is tunelled usually doesn't require TCP with it's guaranted delivery (and slowdown) because a tunnel already handles network issues. The only thing that application wants is a transport which establishes connection, that's why it uses TCP socket.

I decided to implement a software which sits on both sides of a tunnel, catches TCP packets on tunnel network interface (e.g. `tun0`), prevents them from being sent, wraps them into UDP and sends to it's instance on the other side.

Currently have some tasks around pulling together some central process for the upkeep of our infrastructure (Patching critical devices for vulnerabilities/ bugs etc).  Unfortunately, we don't have any central inventory or NSOT system due to the way org is structured to use as a base. (Separate distinct BUs)

The current process is around excel documents and manual data entry from version reports (Cattools) and then manual lookups to Vendors for the latest code etc.

Was wondering how others have this and what tooling you may use?  Dabbled in some Python scripts to pull vulnerability details from cisco and have been thinking how to pull this into a repeatable process and automate as much it as possible, as this will be handed off to other teams to manage on day-to-day.

My initial thoughts were NSOT  (Netbox?) w/inventory of devices &gt; interacts with devices to get the latest data (NAPALM/ ANSIBLE) &gt; interacts with vulnerability data (Via Public APIs) &gt;  engineer reviews data (New vulnerability this version X is vulnerable)  and initiates upgrades.  (Actual upgrade part is separate although forms part of the process).

Powerapps (Microsoft) could be an option for that external lookup but might involve some manual entry.

Luckily I believe our Sonicwall 5600N will allow for IP addresses to have a NAT that I believe we can map back to our customer's public IP address. What kind of configuring would the customer have to do? Are there any foreseen issues that can arise without having knowledge of his internal private network? How can I start doing this process automatically instead of manually? Thanks in advance.",Site-to-Site VPN,r/networking,0.62,6,1586897657.0,,,18
547,t3_g122r8,"Hi,

at our university we have a lab in which students can get exprience working with Cisco (ISR 4331) and Juniper routers (SRX 240) with BGP, OSPF, etc...
They have a dedicated Internet link and get the full BGP tables, v4 and v6.
We now have the issue that the ISRs seem to run out of memory when we try to use both tables and we have to preaggregate the routes which we want to avoid.
Now the people responsible want to buy new ISRs (or similar) that can hold both tables.
As we all don't really know Ciscos products and their website is kind of confusing, could you maybe recommend which router we should buy?

EDIT: There are no bandwidth requirements, VPN user requirements or anything that a normal business would consider. Literally the only requirements are:

- BGP v4 and v6 with full tables
- OSPF v4 and v6

The idea is that students can get a feel for IOS doing small tasks that are relevant for the real world.

EDIT: We will probably do a memory upgrade on the ISRs now to 16GB which should work. Thanks for all the responses!",Smallest Cisco router that can hold the full BGP table?,r/networking,0.79,25,1586883304.0,,,28

Hi Reddit

I have been a Network Engineer for about 10 years, achieved my CCIE, worked for a few companies (ISP, Vendor Enterprise) and was hoping to look into starting my own business - Guess I have an entrepreneurial spirit and would like to be my own boss + would like having a career with the opportunity to scale. (more than one client) 

What options are available out there for Network Engineers to do this? When I try and google Network Engineer Consultant (My City) I do not seem to find any businesses, what I do find is contract for larger companies / Project work. Is that the only option out there for us?

When I look at doing something that caters to small businesses, they seem to be MSP’s that are much more Microsoft / Sysadmin focused, from what I can see they all seem to keep their engineering staff in house.

I guess another way to ask this, does any company outsource Network Engineering services ?",Possible to start your own business as a Network Engineer?,r/networking,0.92,130,1586877847.0,,,66
549,t3_g1104g,"Has anyone attempted to implement BGP peers with 31-bit prefix links between Nexus devices? 

We are having some issues with BGP peerings where a new peer will sit at Idle/Active until the Nexus are rebooted. Once a reboot is done, the peer comes up and is able to be bounced even and will still come back up. It seems like the Nexus may not be allowing the session on a per-neighbor basis. It seems to work if you use prefixes below /31. 

IP reachability between the two devices is fine. ARP looks good and Ping works as well as other protocols. It just will not bring up the neighbor initially unless a reboot occurs.

I'm a bit stuck here. I'm building out a new configuration which includes:

- Fortigate 500E firewall (HA pair)
- Brocade 7750 Core Switch
- ISP MPLS connection (BGP)
- ISP Internet connection

I plan to have the gateways for my private subnets on both the Firewall and the Core switch. (More secure networks on the Firewall so I can apply policies, less secure on the core)

I have a couple of options I'm considering, but I'm not sure which is best:

1) Terminate all ISP connections into Firewall (including MPLS) and then peer Firewall BGP with MPLS, and peer Firewall BGP/OSPF with Core Switch

2) Only terminate internet into Firewall, peer firewall with core switch BGP/OSPF, then peer core switch BGP with MPLS.

560,t3_g0ayze,"Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with or can throw out some advice on how to load balance multiple *incoming* RTMP streams. I realise that there are TONS of articles etc about load balancing *outgoing* streams to viewers, but we're a media company who ingests streams at scale so we're on the other end of the spectrum.

At the moment, we pre-provision a dedicated ""slot"" on a server instance running Wowza Streaming Engine for each client source that we sign up (up to a maximum of 5 per server) - obviously this is not:

1. Scalable or
2. Sustainable or
3. Affordable

We're going through a phase of really rapid growth at the moment, and I would much rather find a way to have a standing pool of available servers which I can dynamically allocate individually per incoming stream as required - that way we're only really worried about ""how many streams we're ingesting concurrently"" rather than ""how many servers do I need to have running in case *X* clients send us a stream"". Basically it will mean instead of having 25 servers running 24/7 to ingest 125 *potential* streams, we can run, say, 15 or 20 smaller servers to handle one connection each, but concurrently - ideally even only spin up the required number of servers for a known number of concurrent scheduled streams (if we know we're only going to be doing 10 concurrent ingests, then we only need 10 instance running).

**NXOS Blame** enables you to determine who made what change on a cisco nexus switch in a cute and tidy GUI. This was inspired by the blame feature on Github.

The way this works is heavily reliant on the ""show accounting log"" command available on Cisco Nexus devices. The output from that command is then compared with the running configuration.

Keep in mind that this project is proof of concept. In a real production environment, it's probably better to collect ""show accounting log"" daily and accumulate the dataset so that older accounting data is not lost. :)

I am creating an network across 2 buildings. I have layer 3 switches acting as my main routers in each building with a fibre connection between them. These connect to L3 switches in each company department which provide PoE to IP phones and onwards to the PC behind the phone.

I have a dedicated Call Manager (CM) Router set up in each building, directly connected to the main L3 routing switch. Every phone has successfully registered and I can call other phones in the same building. However, I cannot call a phone in another building.

I also discovered that I cannot ping the CM router in either network from any device (either in the same building or outside it). I can only ping as far as the gateway interface to the device.

I think it is a routing issue, but I am stumped as the call managers clearly work and have a connection to my network or the phones wouldn't work.

Do you have any suggestions for things to check or something I am missing to enable cross-building phone calls and/or to ping the CM routers?

**Network set up notes:**

* Each department is it's own VLAN and the voice has it's own VLAN. Voice and Access ports are all set up.
* Inter-vlan routing is OK - I can ping from PCs in one building to PCs/Servers/Wireless devices in the other.
* EIGRP is set up on both the building L3 switches doing the routing but not the department ones
* Every network is listed correctly in the EIGRP topology table

Hi Guys!

I was assigned to a team that has to config dot1x to a company switches. My main domain is routing and switching only but i have done some research about the command usage.

Here's the template i got from the PM (Port only):

*-----------------*

interface range fastEthernet 0/1-24

 switchport access vlan X (Data)

 switchport mode access

 switchport voice vlan Y (Voice)

 authentication event fail action next-method

 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan X (Data) (Same Vlan X in the switchport access vlan X command)

 authentication event server dead action authorize voice

 authentication event server alive action reinitialize

 authentication host-mode multi-domain

 authentication order dot1x mab webauth

 authentication priority dot1x mab webauth

 authentication port-control auto

mab

 dot1x pae authenticator

 spanning-tree portfast

*-----------------*

*Let me explain the commands with my understanding first.*

*The commands:*

*-----------------*

authentication host-mode multi-domain

 authentication event fail action next-method

 authentication order dot1x mab webauth

 authentication priority dot1x mab webauth

 authentication port-control auto

*-----------------*

This is a port which has a Computer with an IP Phone attached to it. The order of authentication is dot1x, MAC Address, webauth, and the last line is enable dot1x on the port.

Now these command that i think i don't fully understand, it would be great if you guys can help me clarify these:

The commands:

*-----------------*

 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan X (Data)

 authentication event server dead action authorize voice

 authentication event server alive action reinitialize

mab

 dot1x pae authenticator

*-----------------*

When the Radius servers is dead the voice device will be placed in the voice vlan command in the interface configuration, and the computer will be placed in the data vlan in the switchport access command. User start authenticate to Radius server when the servers are up again.

What do the **mab** and **dot1x pae authenticator** do?

In this configuration, i don't see the commands that help the PC &amp; IPPhone to authenticate to radius server or talk with ISE when the servers is up but when i use the config, everything works fine. Am i missing something?

I hope you guys can help me.

567,t3_fzlqp1,"Hey guys,

Are any of you guys managing a VPN so video editors can edit from home on HP's RGS soultion? What is your experience like with dual monitors vs single monitor?

We  have a few editors having some problems with lag or pixelations. The  internet on both sides is good. The latency and the bandwidth are good.

Our  VPN seems good. It gets around 50Mbps per thread. So if I do an SMB  speed test I get around 50Mbps. And if I do a FTP transfer across ten  threads I get around 300Mbps.

I’m  wondering if the single thread way the vpn seems to bottleneck has  anything to do with the lag. The editor has 1 gig up and down and so  does the office. So it’s not bandwidth.

I can see that the bandwidth uses around 30Mbps per user. So I’m a little hesitant to blame the VPN.

Anyways I just want to know what your guys experience is with RGS?

I hope you are all safe!

I having some difficulties setting up access points in my lab. I am working on packet tracer and I have Wireless Controller 2504 which is connected to a SW. I already set management IP to my controller and logged into it to create Sample Guest SSID (I am not the best in wireless btw). On the other side I had one access point (Lightweight) connected to another SW, the port connected to the SW is on VLAN 100 (AP VLAN) and the controller is set to be in IT VLAN (I do have into VLAN routing so everything is printable)

Logging into my controller seems fine, it can see my AP and DHCP gave the AP IP from the AP's Pool)

The problems is that laptops with Wireless card are not able to connect to that access points and I do not see why.

I hope someone has explanation here otherwise I am stuck with AP's not working :(

571,t3_fyygsw,"This isn't an active design challenge that I have, but I'd like to have an idea about how you all are securing your management environments today. 

* Are you relying on special jump hosts, VDIs, or VPNs for your administrators to use?
* Do you have a physical NOC set up with its own privileged subnet?
* Are you leveraging 801.1x or similar technologies to ensure your administrators' devices are assigned to privileged subnets?
* Are you not putting any network-based restrictions on access to management IP addresses?
* Have you adopted some alternative strategy?

Relying only on the jump host option seems extremely dangerous since a network failure could prevent you from accessing the very infrastructure you need to fix the network. But leaving everything open, particularly for out of band, seems risky too (anyone with the console line credentials could access a network device).

I would approach this by using 802.1x to ensure that all administrators belong to a special IP subnet, and allow that subnet access to the VTY lines and out of band terminal servers. If 802.1x wasn't an option, I probably would allow the entire enterprise IP space to have access to the VTY lines, but set up a special jump host for out-of-band access.

580,t3_fygo91,"Hi ALL, I studying DMVPN phase 3 and would like to ask if you can answer some of my question and issue that I'm working on right now. 

Topology: [https://imgur.com/ZLYelUk](https://imgur.com/ZLYelUk)

Description: From the topology, I have 3 sites A, B and C and all routers are DMVPN configured. From the topology also you can see that Site B and C (spoke-to-spoke) communication is working but Site A &amp; B is not working. 

**Questions:**

1. In which specific database HUB stores the route information from its spoke routers ? if is based on RIB, FIB or NHRP database ? with this, HUB know where to forward the traffic and also this being use to send a redirect whenever there a better path that spoke could use.
2. From the topology, Site A has a preferred path from HUB perceptive which is to forward Site A lan network to another PE and not directly to HUB. With this, this affect the spoke-to-spoke communication. Could you give input about this, Does hub needs to have the best path towards to its Peer tunnel to send a redirect (related to #1)?
3. Can we able to run a spoke-to-spoke test between Site A and Site B using their tunnel interface IP addresses since it is directly connected and not being manipulated?

&amp;#8203;

    example:
    Site A - R2 (tunnel 0 - 192.168.1.10/24)
    Site B - R (tunnel 0 - 192.168.1.20/24)
    
    SiteA# ping 192.168.1.20 source 192.168.1.10
    Result: Working
    SiteA# trace 192.168.1.20 source 192.168.1.10
    Result: 2hops away - HUB -&gt; SITEB ROUTER
    
    Same result with Siteb to Sitea ping and trace.

4.  All spoke routers have IPSEC profile configured but Site A and Site B ***spoke-to-spoke communication unable to fully form phase2 IPSEC.*** All policies, attributes are the same since we cannot form an adjacency with hub if there something missing... So believe this is due to the fact we cannot form a spoke-to-spoke communication because of the preferred path? BTW im using the tunnel interfaces to test (see #3 sample).

We are running multiple nexus leafs (93180yc-ex's, and 9348's, with 9364 spines) all running 9.2(4). Since having deployed this, we have had a lot of issues with arp.

Devices getting put on a new VLAN, but then it has two arp entires, and it is not flushing the old arp out.

Devices with correct IP on correct VLAN being able to be reached via local leafs and not over the fabric.

Devices moving from one site to another site, keeping the same IP, and with the wrong vlan interface.

Or even better yet. Device with correct IP, on correct VLAN interface, arp just randomly stops working, and we have to issue the below command:

luckily this command is our saving grace:

583,t3_fydev7,"Hi

Being mostly a systems engineer these days I also have to tend to some networking in our school here and I've been working with a couple of FASTPATH-based switches from Netgear, Ubiquiti and Dell lately and int the past.

From time to time I'm trying to revisit old habits in order to check if I an initial choice was good or not if time allows. I'm trying to decide whether switchport mode general vs.  switchport mode access/trunk are wiser to use or if it's just a matter of personal taste. :-)

Most of these FASTPATH-based switches tend to use ""switchport mode general"" by default where VLAN partiticipation, tagging and PVID has to be defined (also ingress filtering often is not enabled by default). Based on checking with older models of those vendors, general mode used to be the only available mode in FASTPATH. Access/trunk modes have their origins in IOS and were added by Broadcom a couple of years ago and now exist alongside seemingly without an intend to drop one or another config mode.

I've compared a port config of an access port when in general vs. access mode as well as general vs. trunk mode. The port configs tend to be a bit shorter and (by my personal taste) less clunky than in general mode. (roughly 2 lines per port)

Of course mixing both general vs. access/trunk usage is likely unwise as it might rather lead to confusion... but any preferences from day-to-day experiences?",FASTPATH-based switches: switchport mode general vs. access/trunk?,r/networking,0.85,47,1586543173.0,,,19
584,t3_fybt02,"I need your help with a problem.

I'm trying to setup basic QinQ between a distribution-switch (DLS) and an access-switch (ALS) but it doesn't seem to work.

Between the two switches I use VLAN 10 as the management VLAN and both switches have an IP-address on the VLAN interface in the subnet 10.0.10.16 /28. Without QinQ they can both ping each other without any issues. I use VLAN 10 as MGMT and VLAN 1010 is supposed to be the outer vlan-tag.

The DSL is a HPE 5710 switch, and the ALS is a HPE 5130 switch.

Config DLS (port):

     port link-mode bridge
     description Link To ALS
     port link-type trunk
     undo port trunk permit vlan 1
     port trunk permit vlan 10 1010
     port trunk pvid vlan 1010
     qinq enable
     qinq transparent-vlan 10
     undo stp enable

Config ALS (port):

     description Link To DLS
     port link-type trunk
     undo port trunk permit vlan 1
     port trunk permit vlan 10 101 to 124 
     undo stp enable

This should work right? Tho' as soon as I enable QinQ on the DLS, I lose connection with the ALS trough VLAN 10. I can't ping anymore. Do I have to enable QinQ globally in some way on the 5710?

I've tried this setup on several other switches including the last setup with two 5130's and it works just fine. There seems to be something with the 5710's that just doesn't work.. Any ideas?

586,t3_fy93j4,"I work with several large enterprise customers and most of them are getting rid of their onsite data centers. They are either moving all their applications to cloud providers, moving their DCs into colocations, or doing a mix of both. This means that soon enough, all client-to-server traffic will flow over the WAN, with the campus essentially becoming one large remote-site. As for client-to-client traffic, I won't say it doesn't exist, but it is relatively inconsequential.  VoIP RTP sessions don't take up much bandwidth, and the same goes for Machine-to-Machine IOT traffic.

Now that I've established what current and future traffic flows look like, let's talk about WAN connectivity. Outside of DCs, none of my customers have any circuits larger than 1gb; in fact, line rate, dedicated GigE circuits are still pretty rare. As DC sites, they all have 1gb to 10gb circuits for branch WAN aggregation, centralized corporate internet/cloud access, and data center interconnection. But what will happen to these sites when they no longer host DCs or provide branch WAN aggregation? Well, I fully expect my customers to decommission their 10gb circuits and move to 1gb or even 500mb services at their campuses. 

We're looking at a future where (1) all substantial traffic flows will be constrained to the size of WAN links and (2) WAN links at former ""hub"" sites will be sized only based on the needs of local users. So why is Cisco pushing access-layer switches with multi-gig access ports and 25/40/100gb uplinks? It seems to me that 1GigE access ports and 10GigE Trunks are still more-than-sufficient for today's requirements. Now I get why someone might argue for 25gb uplinks - switches don't have nearly the same buffering capabilities as routers, so you want your campus backbone to be oversized. But giving a user or a single AP a switchport that's sized like a WAN circuit in a world where *everything* goes over the WAN? That sounds like nonsense to me. 

I get that there's product lifecycle to consider, but until you can get a 25GigE circuit for the same price as today's 1GigE's, (not something that I see happening in the next 5 years...) this whole technology and ""push"" from Cisco seems pointless to me.

We have a handful of users who lose their split-dns functionality after they are connected to the VPN for awhile.

When they try to ping internal DNS name, using the on prem Microsoft DNS server it just says ""Ping request could not find host xyz.helloworld.local Please check the name and try again.""

Funny enough nslookup will work, but I researched that it stated: 

**Note**: **Avoid using NSLookup when you test the name resolution on the client.** Instead, rely on a browser or use ping. This is because NSLookup does not rely on the operating system (OS) DNS resolver, and therefore, AnyConnect does not force the DNS request via a certain interface.

After they were installed and set up, the vendor made another map of the radio signals to confirm that the coverage was optimal.

Please suggest me way to fix this issue. The network is almost unusable due to this. We are getting only 10 Mbps for whole village. So now people can't even use Gmail. I have been through at least 100 websites. This is my third day. I was thinking of posting this first day but I thought it would be an offending idea to post such silly questions on first day.

Hope I get help.

Edit: I have successfully blocked Tiktok. Method I have been through is I added every domain and IP there I can find. And blocked it through firewall. There are almost 70+ ip and domains. Also after that I used pihole hosted on external vps on digital Ocean. Used that as dns server. But it's very slow. So I have seen somewhere there is hosted version on cloud. I have yet to go through all comments and I'm not sure if I have seen it in this sub or somewhere. And checked every request and blocked any remaining tiktok links from there.

It's so amazing to have such nice comments from you guys. Thanks. For this help I would like to help you out with another thing. If you ever come to Nepal I will host you and take you to mountains and ride motorcycle for 1500 kms. All the lodging and fooding will be on me. Lots of love guys.

614,t3_fx07mi,"So how do you use RED/WRED at your company? I've done a lot of QOS implementations, and I've always questioned the value of RED with how most companies implement it.

I've heard arguments that it helps prevent TCP global synchronization, but is synchronization actually happening in your network without a RED profile? Most of the research I've read showing global synchronization conducted their testing in a controlled environment with flows having similar characteristics (algorithm, latency, processing time, RTT). I have not seen global synchronization in our production network, nor have I seen it in a lab where we weren't explicitly trying to create it. Reading through some research where different RTTs and different processing times are used, you don't see global synchronization occurring.

What's consistent with a lot of the research I've read through is fairness and latency. RED is fairer to bursty traffic or traffic with long RTT. But for the most likely scenarios, tail-drop works fine or may even be better for smooth non-bursty traffic. In any case, the average of drop probability and throughput between tail-drop and RED are pretty identical. While latency can be far lower with RED, that's because you're essentially lowering the queue depth. This could be ideal in specific scenarios, especially with WRED. But that kind of granularity requires engineers to have an excellent understanding of their traffic flows and needs.

What I often find with most deployments, RED/WRED is implemented without really knowing if it provides any benefit. There are a few scenarios where I could see the benefit, but I don't even know if the benefit is worth the added complexity.

So if you have RED/WRED implemented in your network, how is it implemented and what benefit does it provide? How did you determine the min and max thresholds and drop probability? Have you done testing to show that it actually provides an advantage over just doing tail-drop, or is it all theoretical?",Benefits of RED/WRED,r/networking,0.8,15,1586351182.0,,,29

I have a situation with Fortigate (501E), no VDOMs. Routing is ""on a stick"" - no L3 switches.

2. There is a policy which allows ANY -&gt; VLAN 104 for these VIPs
3. There is a routed network x.y.78.0/24 on internal network (VLAN 71)
4. There is a server x.y.78.30 on said network (VLAN 71)
5. There is policy which allows VLAN 71 -&gt; ANY

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is server x.y.78.30 can connect anywhere on the internet EXCEPT this service (x.y.89.164)On the diag debug flow (with filter ""addr x.y.78.30"") I can see only packets going in, and they are allowed by policy, ant correctly DNAT'ed to 10.10.104.31

On the other hands ping (x.y.78.30 -&gt; x.y.89.164) works, but the ping reply comes from [10.10.104.31](https://10.10.104.31)!

asymroute is enabled.

I just can't wrap my head around this, is this NAT somehow not registering ? But it doesn't show even reply direction packets from [10.10.104.31](https://10.10.104.31) (even when using ping).

If this would be a same internal network - I would just hairpin NAT to router IP ant call it a day, but on  webserver's logs I want to see the real IP (x.y.78.30).

Mostly residential ISP connections with consumer equipment that was setup by local staff or region technicians.  We intend to try and upgrade about 80 sites with managed switches, access points, and firewalls.  Sounds great so far, right?

Now the not so great part.  Most of these sites are really small, like 3 people and a drobo small.

I currently work in an environment with a multi datacenter setup. We are connecting the datacenters via private cross connects using the colo's backbone. On the initial setup we ran into spanning tree issues that were beyond my understanding (tri node colo setup). 

After further investigation we noticed that the VLAN we were using for the cross colo connection was identifying its root bridge as being on both switches in each datacenter. We resolved this by setting the spanning-tree priority on the VLAN lower on one of the datacenters. It was also recommended that instead of using access ports for the cross datacenter connection we use trunk ports and only allow the particular VLAN across. 

IE: Instead of switchport access vlan 1000 

we were recommended to change the port type to: 

switchport trunk allowed vlan 1000

switchport trunk native vlan 1000 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a very poorly described scenario but would someone be able to explain the difference between an access port and a trunk port where you are only allowing 1 vlan across? Is there a difference or preferred method? 

Lastly, 

Say i have two Cisco Nexus switches in a VPC domain in each datacenter(1 vpc domain per DC). If i am going to set the root bridge priority on one side(IE: Datacenter A) should that priority be specified on both switches in the vpc domain or just the switch the particular link is connected to? (Note the cross datacenter links are orphaned ports, it only uplinks to 1 switch and is not in a port  channel as it is not a dual handoff setup)

I dove into all the logging and NetFlow information I can, and it appears that as soon as the Nessus scanner starts the SYN part of the scan, the switches start throwing Spanning tree PVID inconsistency errors or SSTP BPDU with bad TLV errors. The VSS attempts to mitigate whatever causes this by blocking and unblocking VLANs on the aggregate links (lacp active) to no avail, and within 4 minutes of the scanner starting, I get switches that begin crashing and throwing traceback and IPC errors and will make and render the switch unmanageable/unaccessible and stop forwarding traffic.

Supposedly they got this from a reputable source but I'm wondering how anyone could know of any impending attack - ?


“It has come to the attention of the Avaya security team the potential of a major SIP Denial Of Service attack in the next few days. 
 
As far as we know, the attack is targeted to be launched against major US infrastructure companies in telecom, oil, healthcare, and insurance sectors in a couple of days (perhaps even as soon as Monday).  State-sponsored hackers called Advance Persistent Threats APT-28 (Fancy Bear) and APT-29 (Cozy Bear) are believed to be affiliated with Russian GRU (military intelligence) and with some Iranian factions.  They are acquiring enormous quantities of BOTs on the Dark Web in preparation for DDoS attacks and training their devices with lists of IP addresses that respond to SIP.  
  
They are using RPC Portmapper DUMPs and SIPVicious scanners to detect IP addresses that respond to their (currently) benign traffic queries that are used for portmapping target devices and networks.
  
What follows will be a major (terabit/second) attack on major infrastructures in the West.   I wanted to share this with you whether you use Avaya SBCs or not. 
 
If using Avaya SBCs,  our guidance is to reprogram the SBCs to turn on Denial of Service prevention attacks. SBCs are usually set to “observe” mode.  It will need to be turned on and traffic shaping/limiting turned on to prevent further damage.

On paper multi-instance tech looks rather good - full separation with independent upgrades, resource allocation and so on.

They will be managed by the same staff, but are serving different purpose and splitting them makes sense to me (currently they are two different physical FWs). They can be merged in case there are strong points against multi instance approach and going classic HW active/passive HA.

Hi all, I have a strange problem that I'm hoping to get some input on.

I have a bunch of Azure subscriptions, and a bunch of different pieces of equipment making tunnels to them from different physical locations. Over the last month I've been upgrading all tunnels from the [default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices) Azure IKEv2/IPsec configuration to meet a particular security standard. I do this with a [custom Azure IPsec Policy.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell#managepolicy)

&amp;#x200B;

The default:

IPsecEncryption: AES256

IPsecIntegrity: SHA256

IkeEncryption: AES256

IkeIntegrity: SHA96

DhGroup: DHGroup2

PfsGroup: None

&amp;#x200B;

My new policy:

IPsecEncryption: AES256

IPsecIntegrity: SHA256

IkeEncryption: AES256

IkeIntegrity: ECP256 (this is how Azure refers to group 19)

DhGroup: ECP256 (group 19)

PfsGroup: ECP256 (group 19)

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I have completed this upgrade successfully with about 10 tunnels, mostly with Cisco ASAs, but also some Ubiquiti EdgeRouters, and one Ubiquiti USG. It's been easy and smooth.

Now, I'm trying to configure the same thing with a Cisco ISR 4331. The problem I'm running into, is that the ISR doesn't seem to be honoring my new ""Tunnel protection ipsec profile.""

I have configured the below on my ISR, and then I put the custom IPsec policy in place on the Azure side. The tunnel drops. If I remove the custom IPsec policy from Azure, but LEAVE THE CONFIGURATION ON THE ISR, the tunnel establishes... uses the old default settings. How is this possible?

If I run ""show crypto ikev2 sa"" and ""show crypto ipsec sa"" I see the tunnel established with the old crypto settings. How is this possible when I have configured my new IPsec profile with ""tunnel protection ipsec profile MynewStuff"" ??? Is the ISR allowed to ignore that if something is wrong? I'm very confused. Am I missing a step here? I have tried clearing the SAs after reapplying the custom ipsec profile in Azure, but the tunnel just wont establish until I remove it, and allow it to use the defaults, which the ISR should see as a mismatch.

I'm in IOS XE 16.09.05. Very grateful for any help or insight you might have. Thanks.

Edit: After much pain and learning how to properly debug, the issue is that the Tunnel Interface is indeed trying to negotiate using the old IPsec profile. Waiting to attempt a reboot to see if that clears it. That old IPsec profile has been DELETED at this point, so this is strange.

!!!SOLVED!!! After a reboot, the desired tunnel came up right away... but NONE OF THE OTHER TUNNELS. Maybe it was my panicked mind (1 tunnel down is ok... all EXCEPT one tunnel down is a major emergency... 15 minutes left on the window... it hit me. All these tunnels are on the same interface and fvrf. THEY WERE ALL MATCHING THE FIRST POLICY! I got rid of all the other policies, and defined TWO different PROPOSALS in the SINGLE IKEv2 policy!

We have a fairly mature and stable production ACI system for our intranet server infrastructure, and I was wondering if I could extend this to our DMZ servers.

Also, all of the AppProf/EPG/VRF/BD would be contained within a separate tenant in ACI as well.

I am planning to follow the instructions [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/800-series-routers/12065-pswdrec-827.html). As I've never touched a Cisco device in my life, I'm a bit gun-shy so I would like to first attempt a backup with `copy startup-config tftp:` after doing my `copy startup-config running-config` when I'm in privileged mode after setting the `confreg 0x2142`. Maybe that's overkill?...but I'd feel better knowing I have a backup of the current config before I touched anything else.

The problem I'm running into now is this: The documentation linked above only refers to resetting the `enable` password. But when I console into the router, I'm first seeing a `Username:` prompt. From what I'm able to understand via Google, it looks like the person who set up the router also created a ""local login"" account? And that is separate from the ""privileged"" mode password?

Now I'm lost as to see *what* the username is....(a way to list all users?). I'm also confused as to what is needed now in terms of *recovery*. I need to recover both the `enable` password and the username/password for this ""local login"" account?

It would be greatly appreciated if someone here could guide me as to what is needed to simply console into this router, reset all the username/password(s), while also keeping all of the config in-tact (preferably with a backup from the start).",Cisco 881 router - username/password recovery,r/networking,0.6,1,1585984764.0,,,10

694,t3_fuebfv,"Hey

I'd like to get StrongSwan working with a Fortigate unit. The VPN tunnel uses ikev1 with certs and then xauth. So that's an easy leftauth=pubkey, leftauth2=xauth. Well, no.. That just doesn't work. It gets stuck, the firewall cannot find the sent cert it messes up. It's because the official Forticlient vpn client sends request as if it was ONLY authenticating by cert and then some magic happens and some time later sends xauth too.

This is from a working Forticlient (debug on the vpn fw):

    ike 0:fc67cd9d55028ab8/0000000000000000:13986: ISAKMP SA lifetime=86400

which eventually lands

    ike 0:XXXXNAMEHEREXXXX:13986: peer CERT not found

As can be seen, auth\_method should only be rsa\_sig and not rsa\_sig\_xauth\_i. Which is only leftauth=pubkey. But that also doesn't work as then StrongSwan neither responds to xauth requests nor does it send on its own.

Now back to the working Forticlient debug log (on fw):

    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: initiating XAUTH.
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: sending XAUTH request
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: enc 
    ...
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: sent IKE msg (cfg_send): ip and stuff here
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: peer has not completed XAUTH exchange
    ike 0: comes ips here
    ike 0: IKEv1 exchange=Mode config id=blabla
    ike 0: in blabla
    ike 0:XXXNAMEHEREXXX:13984: blabla
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: received XAUTH_USER_NAME 'my.user' length 10
    ike 0:VPNNAME:13984: received XAUTH_USER_PASSWORD length 16
    ike 0:VPNNAME: XAUTH user ""my.user""

Which again is quite f#\*&amp;n odd... It seems like Fortigate FW sends XAUTH request, Forticlient doesn't respond and then yet it just sends XAUTH on its own? Despite its initial type=AUTH\_METHOD, val=RSA\_SIG ???

&amp;#x200B;

Seems absolutely out of spec for me.. Is there any way I can get StrongSwan behave that way? Or any other open source client for that matter. So again. FW is configured to use cert for auth and then xauth (via ldap integration)

In brief:
I'm working with the new Aruba CX switch line. 802.1q ports (which are now called 'trunks' again! LAGs are now called LAGs!) can have a ""Native Untagged vlan"" or a ""Native Tagged vlan"".  

Native Untagged vlan: Exactly what you'd expect.

      no shutdown
      no routing
      vlan trunk native 60
      vlan trunk allowed all  

Inbound untagged frames are accepted into vlan 60. All tagged frames are accepted.
Oubound frames are all tagged, except for vlan 60 frames, which are always untagged.

Native Tagged vlan:  

    interface 1/1/5
      no shutdown
      no routing
      vlan trunk native 60 tag
      vlan trunk allowed all  

Inbound untagged frames are DROPPED. Inbound frames must be tagged to be accepted, even on the native vlan.
Outbound frames are tagged. Outbound frames on the native vlan, vlan 60, are tagged.

Why is that a ""Native Tagged vlan"" and not ""no native vlan""? I was originally considering BPDUs and STP... but no. If there's a difference there, I'm not seeing it yet. (Disclaimer: I'm using an OVA, not a real switch...)

Oh, and since I brought it up, LAGs are something like...

     interface lag 1                 ; Space required between 'lag' and '1'. Grr.
       lacp mode active
     interface 1/1/1

i am new to EVE-NG, i've been using eve-ng for couple of weeks ago, it's really good, but what is the best way of using it, i integrated it with vmware workstation pro, and added some images, but how can i for example create a windows 10 or windows server on vmware station and integrate it with the eve-ng nodes.

for example, imagine i want to use mikrotik with 2 pcs, inside and outside, i want to l2tp vpn from the outside pc to the inside network, how can i build up this scenario on eve-ng, but i want to use the windows pcs on the vmware work station pro.

I've recently been messing around with WireShark and noticed this:

The data packet length is greater than the MTU, which in my case should be around 1500. Yet, when I check the DF flag, it's set to 1. 

I understand that it would then use Path MTU discovery, but what I don't understand is how it can then fragment the packet if it's been told not to fragment in the first place!

722,t3_ftmmhk,"Hello!  


My boss tasked me with creating the required infrastructure to work from home.  


Now, my job has multiple locations that need to be connected, but, i also need to separate them so someone from location A can't connect to location B and vice-versa, also, there should be good security.  


Now, we have a rack in a datacenter and badass internet, so, my plan is as follows:  
Setup 2 VPN servers, one that does the client (VPN A), the other does the destination (VPN B), there's a username and password plus authorised MAC address and a certificate just to be on the safe side.  
Everyone connects to  VPN A, and based on the input data (user+pass+MAC+cert), it forwards the connection to VPN B that makes the final tunnel to the destination.

Because this is unplanned, i have to deal with the employee's home computers as most of them didn't get laptops, and i was thinking that VPN A would accept 3 protocols: L2TP, SSTP and OpenVPN. VPN B will connect to the location over OpenVPN. If you wonder, L2TP and SSTP is more for compatibility, as it has to deal with vastly different configurations and mobile phones.  


As for volume, i expect about 250 people to use it at the same time, and about 5mb/s internet bandwidth per user should be enough, as they need just remote desktop, our network is fully capable to handle this ammount of traffic.

I know it might sound complicated, but having it centralized is an actual requirement.

In terms of functionality and access control everything is working perfectly fine however there is one small issue that has been annoying me (and the handful of users testing the VPN connection) for a while now.

After closing nad restarting the Anyconnect client the ""Connect to"" field is always auto-filled with ""fwvpn (IPsec) IPv4"" instead of the vpn URL used to actually connect. ""fwvpn"" ist the first Hostname that i gave the ASA when i did the first time setup to enable ssh access, interfaces, etc. In the grand scheme of things this isn't actually a real problem as you can simply erase that and retype the URL you want, but i has been irritation nonetheless.

There is OSPF active, but thats only for reachability in the local site. R4 (which connects both sites) doesn't have OSPF active. Just for clarification.

Edit 3

I think it is because the Keepalive packets of R6 and R3, can't be routed back from R1 or R2 to R6 or R3. Because in the Keepalive Message, the outerheader will be NATed and arrives, from R6, at R1. But R1 decapsulates it and tries to send the keepalive back to [10.180.6.6](https://10.180.6.6) (the source interface in R6). But this is a private IP and R1 will never be able to reach that IP over the internet. There should be the public IP of R6 ([10.10.14.6](https://10.10.14.6)).

Edit 4

Ok, right now the tunnels work, but only without keepalives. The keepalives are what the line protocol keeps down (as intended, if they don't work). I also added the MTU 1400, MSS 1360 and mtu path discovery on the Tunnels. Everything works. 

But as soon as the keepalives are active, the tunnels in the enterpriese (R6, R3) change the line protocol to down. Because there is no way to route traffic from R1 (ZScaler) to the source IP of R6 (private IP in Enterprise). And that makes sense to me, but how do I get those keepalives to work? I think I need to NAT the inner header in the keepalive packets..  ",GRE Tunnel issue I can‘t get my head around,r/networking,0.67,4,1585856868.0,,,18
727,t3_ftjw4v,"Hello! My wife and I own a business and I moved everyone to working remotely weeks ago. Our employees (and us) are connecting to our office using RDP over a VPN connection.

That's all working fine, however my solution for the phones was much less elegant. I just forwarded our main office line to a Google Voice line. It's working fine, however my wife and I cannot handle the call volume on one line, so I've started looking into some of these virtual or ""cloud"" PBX systems.

My main question is, does it simultaneously ring for all users, like a normal PBX system would? That's really the only feature we need this for, but I can't find much info on it. That's tells me it's either not offered, or so standard that it's not even listed, haha. I'm not familiar enough with the technology to know what to look for.

Secondly, any recommendations? We need something with a desktop application, rather than just a mobile app like Grasshopper. Like I said, the only other real feature we need is for it to ring on all endpoints so that any one of our employees can answer it.

728,t3_fti2mb,"Hello

I'm a bit lost now, i have this setup:

(Internet) -&gt; \[Stormshield SN900\] -&gt; \[FortiGate\] -&gt; (LAN)

I have a dialup IPSec VPN configured on the FortiGate to provide remote access for my users .

On my Stormshield i have a dedicated public IP, on which i NAT udp500 and 4500 to the FortiGate. The thing is, i had to source  Nat as well, so the FortiGate only sees the IP of the Stromshield as IPSec peer, not the remote public IP.

However, is have some small loss of packet when using the VPN (RDP dropping, mail server disconnected etc...) but the VPN remains UP all time.

I've tried to tweak the TCP MSS but no changes.

Around a month ago a saw a post on this subreddit about syntax highlight using Neovim (see the post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/f2rwal/tutorial_ciscojuniper_syntax_highlight_via_ssh/) for those who use Neovim). Since I don't use Neovim and another user suggested a tool called [chromaterm](https://github.com/hSaria/ChromaTerm) , I gave it a try and found it super nice and easy.

[In this repo](https://github.com/danielmacuare/netcli-highlight) I'm sharing my config with the instructions to use for anyone who is interested. I hope someone else finds it as useful as I did.

2. Reading show ip bgp summary (Arista/Cisco)
3. Reading show interfaces (Cisco / Arista / JunOS)

731,t3_fte1c2,"I'm connecting two Cisco RV320 routers together over VPN - an office and a residence. The office gateway has a static public IP; The residence gateway has a dynamic public IP. The purpose of this VPN is to connect an office IP phone that been moved to the residence.

I was able to do this successfully, repeatedly and reliably when both routers are at the head of their respective networks. If I must, I will deliver the router in this configuration. It will require bridging their current AT&amp;T U-Verse router so the RV320 gets the public IP address. It will upset their current network configuration, but will get the job done for this user.

I would like to save this user some trouble by configuring their RV320 to work from BEHIND their U-Verse router. That is to say, the remote gateway WAN1 port will have a **private IP address** when it reaches out to the office gateway. This turns the RV320 into a network endpoint with only the office IP phone connected. I've had sporadic success creating a tunnel, but I cannot get the tunnel to reconnect if it becomes disconnected. This needs to be seamless and automatic.

732,t3_ftdeup,"Does anyone here know how best to handle these? Specifically the /30ish subnet between the routers? All the BGP guides I find are somewhat generic and always discourage advertising these into BGP itself but never explain why. They mention using an IGP, loopback &amp; static routes, and I do understand how all of that works; but what is recommended in real life scenarios?

I know you can use an IGP to handle this but I am interested in how ISPs connect their iBGP routers.

For example, one datacenter I manage has a BGP session with 2 different ISPs to 2 of my routers. Cogent to router A &amp; Hurricane Electric to router B. They each gave me a small public subnet to peer with them on. These subnets are advertised because they are routable on the Internet. But beyond that I have no idea what ISPs are using to connect routers in their own AS and to external ISPs.

A part 2 to this question would be how ISPs interconnect with each other. I know generally they converge at Internet exchanges with a route reflector/server, but I am interested in the subnets they are using to do this. Are they public and Internet routable?

One last thing. I have 2 different routers, one connected to each ISP (eBGP) and then they were connected to each other (iBGP). They are each getting a partial/default route table from their respective ISP. Instead of using next-hop-self, I simply advertised the /30 into iBGP at each router so they each have an organic route to the next hop ISP router instead of router A announcing itself as the next hop to router B for routes on Cogent. Is there anything wrong with this?
