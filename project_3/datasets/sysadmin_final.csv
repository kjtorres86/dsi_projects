3,t3_gf9rb0,"Every quarter, our company holds an Awards ""ceremony"" - just a section towards the end of our Town Hall. Every employee in the company can nominate anybody else, and the nominations are reviewed by a panel including the company execs.

The morning of the event, my boss Slacked me to make sure the whole team showed up, so I figured our CEO was going to give us a nod. He has mentioned us a few times since this shutdown began.

The Town Hall continued much as it usually does, until we got to the Awards section. There amongst the list of nominees was me, but much more ""surprise and delight""fully **and importantly** was 'IT Team'.

A huge amount of work has gone in over the last year and a half, and having the team recognized in this way was a real moment of pride for all of us. The best part of it was that the biggest nomination was from our CEO's EA, who had historically had a terrible relationship with IT, and now here she was, nominating all of us for an award.

I started writing this post and realized it was going to be a long one, so TL;DR is above. The story of getting from zeroes to heroes follows ...

\-----

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings &amp; Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

We're still a long way off where we need to be, but at least now we know for sure that we're going in the right direction.",IT got recognized in our quarterly awards for the first time ever,r/sysadmin,0.97,1367,89,{'gid_2': 1}

8,t3_gfqrhd,"Just wondering how common time tracking is for sys Admins. Ie. Working on a ticket then logging how much time you spent actively working on it. And being expected to account for your full 8 hour day.


More details below if you're interested.

My work has started imposing time tracking on the IT team. Currently, the reason is that they want to know how many hours the company is spending per client. We are a fairly small company  of less than 100 emloyees. However, I know the management team / VPs love their metrics so I have a feeling it wont go away and will get used to scrutinize our work and time spent etc. Our manager used to work in IT so he thinks he knows everything but naively believes marketing documentation.. You know,  when it says ""with just a few clicks!, then it takes a day or two of setup before you can get to those few clicks.. Then sure enough, you're left explaining why it took so long to get done... I know it's a thing developers typically have to do; and we report into a VP with a dev background so I'm assuming that's a.big deicing force behind it.

I've only ever had it imposed on a team I was on once before because the new director was a heavy micromanager and didn't the NOC did anything but sit at their desk all day. The time tracking was the first thing to get dropped the he was sent to the roof  a few months later.

I absolutely hate time tracking as it feels like you're on a punch clock and not trusted to be an adult and do your job. I've never had any manager question my work ethic as I'm a workaholic so I not concerned about hiding my slacking or anything. I just hate feeling like I'm working under a microscope and every little thing I do will be scrutinized. I'm mainly trying to decide if it's something I just accept and fudge the numbers like im told is common practice (track 30 min blocks of time and just split up the 8 hours however you feel on whichever tickets you worked on), or if maybe it's time to update my resume as it's as uncommon as I think, a sign of distrust and potentially worse things to come.",Is Sysadmin time tracking a thing?,r/sysadmin,0.79,19,57,{}

18,t3_gfsp9z,"I recently notice that my Windows Domain time started to skew about 29 seconds from my time servers. I currently use my core switch system as my time servers. I became aware of this due to some services that interact with vCenter and Windows. 

Currently, on my PDC I have the following regkey set:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

That key points at two IP addresses corresponding to two core switch systems in different data centers. The time drift between the two cores is less than one second. I am running wireshark on the PDC currently and I can see it go out and query the two IP addresses I have set in the key however, I am still seeing time drift of 29 seconds. I've stopped and started the w32time service several times but I am still seeing the same level of drift. When I run:

      c:\windows\system32&gt; w32tm /resync

I get a message from windows saying `The computer did not resync because no time data was available.` I do see the query to the switch core as soon as I attempt to resync.

Any thoughts on this?

**Update:** Figured it out. By default when Windows tries to sync it uses ""symmetric active"" mode. In order to get the PDC emulator to sync with my Nexus Core it has to be set to use ""client mode"". 

In the key:

      HLKM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\NtpServer

I basically listed the following:

    192.168.32.1 192.168.64.1

So, when I did a resync operation I saw the request go out in Wireshark and a response come back from the Nexus core, but the Windows 32 Time service couldn't interpret the response properly. 

To remedy this and make the W32Time service request time in ""client mode"" you have to append the addresses for time in the regkey with a specific flag (credit to /u/DanHalen_phd ). To trigger the Windows Server to query the right way, you have to tell it to use client mode and to do so you need to append a mode indicator to the end of the ip address statement. The regkey values need to be set as such:

      192.168.32.1,0x08 192.168.64.1,0x08

As soon as I did that and restarted the Windows Time Service, two things immediately changed.

2. All systems in all three tiers need to be members of the same domain to permit utilization of domain resources.

The domain has an AD security group, ""srv-servername-ssh"" and if you are a part of that AD security group, you are permitted to log in via SSH.   I use sshd\_config on my servers to specify (via AllowGroups) certain AD groups which are permitted to SSH to the box.   This works, as long as the system realizes the user trying to log in is part of a valid group.

My issue is: in most cases, if I try to perform this command..

    id user1

..it recognizes the AD user, but returns only a few groups (usually only returns 'domain users' group, very rarely returns the membership list).

If I try typing the following, I can see the full group membership:

    getent group srv-servername-ssh

I am lost on why this is happening, but it is preventing reliable SSH login for the domain users who are supposed to be able to , since the server usually doesn't recognize the user as being part of a valid (allowed) group for SSH access.  Any idea?

31,t3_gfy778,"TL;DR

What is planning? Firewall licenses expired, new firewall quickly installed, but not fully configured. Need both running at the same time, on same subnet. Currently cannot connect to any devices pointing to the new gateway when logged into VPN, but can still access devices with the old gateway still statically assigned.

Hey all - been pulling my hair out all day, hoping to get some advice to what I'm overlooking here.

Scenario: SonicWall FireWall is getting replaced by Cisco Meraki FireWall. We were not ready to do the switchover, but licensing expired. We have set up DHCP to point to our Meraki as the Gateway to ensure we're using the licensed content filtering, as our SonicWall CFS expired.

Everything inside our network seems to be fine - users still have internet access, and the content filtering is working.

The problem comes that we're still using our NetExtender VPN licenses, as we haven't done the configuration to get the Cisco Meraki VPN set up with our Active Directory.


The issue we're having is that after the gateway changed in our DHCP and our workstations got the updated gateway, some of our remote users who were using the NetExtender VPN + RDP to get to their desktop are now unable to get to their workstation when the gateway is set to our Cisco Meraki gateway.


Does anyone know what settings I need to adjust to make sure that our NetExtender SSL VPN is able to connect to these machines?

    Gateway 1: 192.168.1.1 -&gt; Points to Fiber Connection
    Gateway 2: 192.168.1.2 -&gt; Points to COAX Connection

The above is an example of the two gateways - not my actual IP addressing. They're on the same subnet, I need to maintain both of them temporarily, as I have a Site-to-Site VPN to an offsite Data Center that I can't break until we pull backups from the DataCenter (previous MSP is still hosting some servers for us - we're working on getting away from them)


Any help would be appreciated - I'm not well versed in networking, and basically learn as I go, but this has me stumped.

* Date requested
* Requestor
* Ticket (if any)

My company has a small client that is running 2008r2, and we were recently approved to upgrade both their physical server as well as their OS.

Like many, I started out as a computer repair technician.  Since then, I’ve been a senior sysadmin, architect, and I’m in management now.  I’m still all of those things.

My first paid gig was in the late 90s when everyone was buying their computers with home service warranties.  I’d drive over a 150 mile radius diagnosing and servicing computers. I’d drive out, diagnose the issue, and usually come back a few days later once the identified part came in.  I got paid by the visit.  A return visit meant more money for me, but all diagnosis were validated over the phone with dispatch, and dispatch would also talk to the customer and ask them some questions too to make sure everything is done right.  It was fun and easy, and educational.  But I was on my own out there.  The customer’s computer was broken. I didn’t have internet access - smartphones didn’t exist.   Laptops were super expensive, and dialing over a cellular modem was stupid slow and also ridiculously expensive.  Nobody did that.  


So, one of my most critical tools (beside my memory and sheer tenacity) involved a blue tri-fold CD case that I bought at Walmart.  Oddly enough, 20 years later, I can still remember picking among the available cases for something that had enough slots but wasn’t too big to fit in my rolling tool/laptop bag and wasn’t too expensive.  CDs were a big deal then.  Cassettes were still on sale, but barely.  They were starting to phase them out entirely.  The iPod was not yet a thing.  CDs were a very big deal.  So, cases were popular and not many were made in China yet, so they were not cheap. 


Anyway, the computer technician’s CD collection was something you had to build yourself.  There wasn’t a standard.  You had to figure out what you needed by yourself.


I collected CDs like found treasures.  I had everything.  DOS, NT, Windows 95/98/ME/2k/XP/Vista and Win7. Windows 8 was never in my case. I never used the DOS CD, it was just something someone had and I got a copy of it because “who knows” if I might need it.  Anyway, for those wondering - DOS only came on floppies - someone converted the install to work off CD.  I’m not sure how, I never looked.  But you bet your ass that went into my case.


I had Windows XP OEM vs Retail.  I had Home vs Pro.  I had the Dell OEM version.   VLM / Enterprise versions.  Server versions. The various XP and Windows versions were CRITICALLY important to have because those of us who figured out how to do a “repair install” properly way back in the day pretty much figured it out on our own. The trick was to have the right VERSION of the CD or your product key wouldn’t work with it.   With the right technique I could even move your windows install to new hardware without a bluesreen.  Believe it or not someone being able to move your windows install to new hardware was kinda unusual at the time.  The worst thing you can do is repair Windows with the wrong CD and then not be able to activate it with their product key, LOL.  Definitely hard to explain to a customer how suddenly their windows isn’t “genuine” anymore.


Previous versions of Windows had much less strict key code checking.  In fact, I used to have a universal code memorized for 95/98.  I have no idea now what it was now.  But this was something that served
me well on many occasions.  I can’t count how many times I’d ask a customer for their original CD cases or manuals (that’s where the code was stuck depending on the product) and they didn’t have it anymore.  Oops.  Time to stick in the bootleg code from the list that I also kept in my CD case, lol.  

People didn’t have high speed internet, even in the mid- (even late-) 2000s you couldn’t count on customers having it.  Some folks just didn’t have it yet.  So, you needed to be self sufficient.

Most of my CDs were copies.  I made a copy of anything I could.  Of course I had Office - all versions.  Thinks like SpinRite, gParted, Paragon Partition Manager, Acronis w/Universal Restore, Ghost...  AV scanners, hijackthis, autoruns.   Custom BartPE.  Other random “all in one” boot CDs.

I also had to have some blank CDs or DVDs for backups or in case I needed to create a boot CD for something.  There’s been at least a few times where I had to leave a place and come back later with a blank CD because I didn’t have a spare on me.  I also kept a blank floppy and a DOS boot floppy (good for BIOS updates) within my CD case.

Anyway, with flash drives being ubiquitous and internet being ubiquitous (my cell can tether at high speed, etc) I started noticing I’m using flash drives more and CDs less. Laptops are not coming with CD drives.  Servers are not coming with CD drives.  Software doesn’t come in a box.

I haven’t used a CD *at all* in at least 5 years.  

I opened my CD case today.  Everything I have touched in many years has been Windows 10.  I won’t need a CD for that.  I don’t have a CD for that.  I thumbed through it all... there’s nothing in it there that I need anymore.  I pulled them all out one by one, considering each one.  For a few of them I would reflexively think for a moment “oh yeah I need that one, it’s a keeper”.  Moments later I would remind myself that “no, I will never need it again.”  


I did save a couple truly unique ones to make an .iso image “just in case I decide to play around with them someday” and then I threw all of the CDs away.  

Though, I’m not sure I’m ready to throw my case away.  It’s weird to realize that I have some odd attachment to this ragged blue peice of junk.  It’s empty.  It has no CDs. I don’t need it anymore.  But it’s still in my drawer.

I do have a collection of software and software tools, but it’s on my hard drive (and also backed up).  These days I just I copy things onto a flash if I need them, or just use them over the network.  I definitely don’t have the same emotional attachment to my current collection of stuff that I seem to have had with my CDs. I know if I lose something these days I can just google it and download it again wherever I am.

(I don't know what this prd.mydomain.local record is for)

Second - in our DNS mgmt on our Windows DCs, there are a few things I don't understand. I do see that 'prd' sub folder under our mydomain.local zone, and it has nameserver records for all three of our DCs. Also, we have the 'Forward Lookup zones' with a '\_msdcs.mydomain.local' in it's own zone, which has nameserver records for all three DCs and CNAMEs for all three DCs. It also has the dc, domain, etc sub folders in it. Then we have our mydomain.local zone with a sub folder for '\_msdcs' which just has nameserver records for all three of our DCs.

Sorry if this is a lot of info all in one here, but I am at a loss at how we can fix this. I also found other posts about broken delegation, but a lot of solutions have been finding some duplicate or erroneous record that they deleted and it fixed the issue. I am not seeing such records in our environment though.

I appreciate any advice and feedback as always!

\*\*EDIT: We removed the prd folder since we determined it wasn't needed, and now the delegation error for that went away. We also found a .local folder with a duplicate record that we'll be deleting as well, which will hopefully solve the other broken delegation.

We are a hybrid environment: ERP/AD/Print/DHCP/AV is on-prem, Sharepoint/m365/webapps are in the cloud. Our process is about 85% cloud, 15% on-prem. If people are offsite they rarely interact with the ERP system via VPN, and AD/Print/DHCP/AV is moot. 

We have gige fiber WAN and Cloud PBX (metaswitch commportal). We have 60 users, 30 are in the main office, 30 are spread around 12-20 remote SF Bay Area jobsites.

I am wanting to gain a better understanding of how ATA plays a role in some of its functions.  Presently on the network we've had ATA alerting the SysAdmins that generic LDAP has been used and to switch to secure LDAP.  What I'm starting to notice is that the devices are falling off of the list after people are changing to port 636 and selecting SSL despite actually obtaining a certificate to go along with it.  

Am I incorrect in thinking that this is literally sending clear-text data over a port that is used for secure encrypted data?  Next time I'm in the office I will have the opportunity to run Wireshark and see if this is indeed the case but I wanted to have an open discussion about this.  I'm assuming that ATA is just checking what port is in use and reporting accordingly and doesn't do any sort of deep dive into the security piece of whether the data is actually secure/encrypted or not. ",Microsoft ATA and discovering unsecure LDAP connections,r/sysadmin,0.5,0,2,{}
117,t3_gfdtjy,"So I'm looking for opinions from folks who are fairly familiar with their choices.

In the interest of job security, we're gonna say this is a ""hypothetical situation"". :D

So let's say that I have an elderly AD and LDAP setup.  Neither speak to each other, so each directory is separate.  Users currently exist in both directories with the same usernames, but no passwords are sync'd.  And of course all the management of these systems is done via arcane tools and scripts that were copied off of scrolls that traversed the Atlantic on the May Flower.

So now I'm (again, hypothetically) looking for a modern directory system.  User accounts for Windows and Linux workstations, so therefore I need AD and LDAP equivalent functionality.  Integrating with Office 365 may be nice, but not 100% necessary.  There are other SaaS services that would use AD or LDAP integration for authentication.  And the current AD domain is irrelevant, so an entirely new domain can be created.

So for options, there is the obvious of on-prem AD.  I've setup AD before to auth Win and Linux users.  I could do old school LDAP on-prem, and a Samba 4 setup for the Windows users.  There are even ""wrapper"" options like Univention that put a GUI on basic LDAP and Samba.  Heck Webmin could probably do the same.

There are cloud offerings like Azure AD (which I think still requires on-prem DC's).  JumpCloud is another one I have started to look at, and am curious about that one.  Okta I think is more for SSO than a directory server.

119,t3_gfdc0z,"Hi all. I hope this is the appropriate place for this question. I work for a small (&lt;10 person) software company and we run an OpenVPN server through Synology DSM's VPN Server module. It's great, because it requires almost zero configuration, authenticates with a username and password by default (which is our preferred authentication protocol over individual client certificates), and supports up to 30 simultaneous connections (plenty for us). 

However, for our macOS users, we are experiencing some exceptionally weird behavior that has been going on and we've been sucking it up for the past few weeks (a headache for our team members who need to access our local Bitbucket server). I have been unable to find any reports of similar behavior online, nor has OpenVPN's authentication troubleshooting proved useful. We have tried OpenVPN Connect Client and Tunnelblick, and use the default .ovpn configuration that is provided by the Synology interface.

Users will attempt to connect to the VPN, receive the error ""Missing external certificate"" which you can continue past anyway, and then often times will have to retry the login 10-15 times getting ""User authentication failed"" errors in the client, until eventually a successful connection is established. We've whitelisted the affected user's IP addresses from the Synology ""Auto Block"" feature which evidently prevents login from an IP after a certain number of failed logins, which did not improve the situation. Interestingly, the VPN Server module's log viewer only shows connect/disconnect events, and not any failed authentication messages. We get similar behavior using Tunnelblick - here's some relevant log information:

Yet I've been searching for a good job for about five years now and even with seven years of experience I can't seem to get a final offer with a good salary. I make it to third round interviews only to be hit with the cultural fit excuse. I think I finally know why based on feedback I've gotten.

For whatever reason, employers don't see what I think of myself. I'm not the most advanced computer guy, and I don't like programming/taking tests. I've been told that I'm eccentric, an acquired taste and intimidating, maybe a bit egotistical and too laid back. These are traits that you would find in Hollywood, Wall Street, Sales, or Law Firms. Not an IT storage closet.  Yet everyone always said I was good at computers and that I should do what I liked for a living so I perused the IT career thinking this would be the perfect place. And I've spent a good portion of my career living up to this idea that eventually the right job will come along. It hasn't. While I've spent more time trying to find a new role than investing in my studies it hasn't prevented me from getting to final interviews for jobs I'm qualified for.

It hasn't been an easy road either. Every job I've ever got wasn't because I was super qualified and I was someone they wanted to work with, it was because they wanted to give me a shot. They also weren't some glamorous tech jobs either like I'd dreamt about. Just start-ups, boring offices, or non-profits with no money. Every boss I've ever had said that to me upon my start date and that is just defeating. I struggled with finding passion for the studying, for dealing with karen's, and I have PTSD from working in a small team filled with gamers, or people who seemed to hate life/are angry. I'm not saying this is the majority of the industry. I haven't had much exposure to the tech industry in general, but that's the type I've run into.

I have recently volunteered to be a mentor for up and coming IT peeps looking to break into the field. I finally feel secure enough and confident in my experience to be able to pass on some wisdom to people that might be earlier in their career path. I'm super grateful for this opportunity because I'll be able to offer insights that I wasn't afforded when I was starting out, and I think a lot of us might share that sentiment. 

I know when I began my career I was the stereotypical ""solo admin"". Responsible for everything, tier 1-3. Printer broke? That's me. Domain trust broke? Also me. It was stressful, and I really had no outlet for support or guidance on best practices or how to handle complex issues technical or otherwise. My guidance came from Google, self learning, and certification opportunities. I didn't have anyone in person that was senior I could get solid guidance from. 

The local program I'm working with is grant funded focuses on minority communities and non-traditional students looking to break into the IT field. (think people of color, career changes, community college graduates etc.) I'll have an opportunity over the next 6-12 months to help them focus their career search, develop skills, and guide them through their early career steps. 

I'm super excited about being able to be a resource for people that might need it most, early in their career with tech. I want to encourage anyone with some experience under their belt to search out your local opportunities and share your knowledge. I know I could have benefitted greatly from having an early career mentor and I know there are more mentees out there looking for guidance than there are mentors willing to step up.

138,t3_gfb188,"My current position is managing two small/mid-sized environments. I'm salaried, one district pays for 100% of my salary and benefits, and the other pays them 30% of that, so the cost comes out to 70% at my actual employer and 30% at my ""contracted"" position.

This works out to being onsite at one district most of the time, and the other I go to three days every two weeks. 

After getting to know the environments, the time and pay should be flipped. The 30% is in necrosis. They haven't made updates to their environment in about 10 years. A majority of their computers are running win7, there's one server (out of support ofc) that runs EVERYTHING for their environment. (DC, Exchange, RDS, DNS, DHCP, File, Print, IIS, applications, etc.) And I'll mention the users briefly... zero technical training. Had a spam campaign come through the other week and over half the users clicked the links in both the email and the secondary website. By some miracle their AV caught it and stopped anything from happening. My contacts over there just shrugged it off as no big deal. They could have lost their entire environment, and it's no big deal to them, business as usual.

The 30% is bleeding me dry. They need more attention than the 70% and they'll need more work down the road. I bring up the fact that they are constantly bombarding me to the 70% and their stance is ""You figure it out."" They don't want to deal with the relationship between the districts, and that this deal was ultimately designed to take advantage of me. Feels like they both want 100% of my time but neither one wants to pay for it.

And of course their stance is ""IT is not that important"", so trying to get these complaints through to management is like throwing shit at a brick wall.

We are looking to have 8 operating systems in use in our environment. We have two hosts. Each host has 2 sockets, and each socket has 10 cores. This means between the two hosts, we would be licensing 20 cores. This is where the information for me has been becoming tricky:

Since this is a virtual environment where the VMs could migrate to the other host, should I be looking to purchase enough licenses for 16 OSEs? And does each ""full license"" contain 2 OSEs? If yes, then my math seems to be as follows:

Cores (20) \* 8 (since each license covers 2 OSEs) = 160 cores to be licensed

Cores / 2 = 80 2-license packs

80 \* \~$121 = $9680 to have this environment fully licensed.

The first part are drops that repeat over and over in the logs. Good to know that the firewall is working but why would it be blocking connections that were originating from my LAN if these were replies to those initial outgoing traffic? Aren't these blocks originating externally and NOT replies to traffic from my network?

The last entry is what I saw after I changed the cable modem DHCP Pool to [10.1.10.2](https://10.1.10.2) \- [10.1.10.2](https://10.1.10.2) forcing the tomato router wan port to be assigned the [10.1.10.2](https://10.1.10.2) address. So whatever that is lost the IP address of [10.1.10.3](https://10.1.10.3) and then sent a broadcast \[ ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff \] to the internal network between my cable modem and router!!! WTF!!?!?!??

Am I misinterpreting this???

The internal and external MAC address of my cable modem interfaces are xx:xx:xx:xx:a6:0a and xx:xx:xx:xx:a6:0e. So the MAC address that appears ass the MACSRC in the logs \[xx:xx:xx:xx:a6:0d\] has to be associated with that cable modem or my ISP.

Thought it was just an Outlook issue until we checked OWA and saw the same thing there.  After a lot of searching we discovered everything missing for both mailboxes was in the respective Archive folders, and I can't figure out why:

&amp;#x200B;

* No AutoArchive settings enabled that I can see, in either Outlook or Exchange Admin Center
* No mail flow rules
* Didn't seem to be an actual ""Archive,"" local or otherwise, but instead just the normal folder named Archive
* User has never even seen the manual Archive option before in Outlook &amp; has certainly never used it
* No suspicious logins on his account (and if someone hacked his account you'd think they'd do something more interesting than relocating emails)
* O365 audit logs shows the user was 'responsible' for the email moves and didn't have OWA open so it has to have happened within his Outlook

The copy has a combination of many fairly small files, and some very big ones. Most are already compressed. The destination is behind a gateway server on which SSH keys are banned. The origin can only be accessed over SSH via VPN. Copying can only take place overnight. The origin does not have enough spare room to create many significant intermediate files. Both ends are having pretty frequent connection issues. It's ZFS to ZFS but we're only taking a subset of the data so we can't just copy a snapshot.

rsync over a jump server is fine; I can use keys to get onto the destination and was thinking of using sshpass to get through the gateway (not ideal, but none of these requirements are, so...). The password needs to be in a file somewhere (cron has to source the environment, or sshpass can read from the file), unless I want to babysit it every evening and morning. I'm going to use a python script to orchestrate the rsync job, restart after connection issues, and send a SIGTERM when our time is up. I'm pretty sure CPU isn't a limiting factor but I'm going to disable compression and use a weak SSH cipher just in case - as I say, most of the files are compressed already. tar over netcat isn't useful because it won't easily resume after an exit.

I have seen some very impressive scripts around here, with powershell interfaces, database backends, communicating with RESTful APIs, etc.

I recently posted asking for advice on an IPAM application I wrote and am refining, with a majority of replies essentially saying stop and don't. I'm not discounting their opinions, I'm aware it's not optimal for many reasons, and it's not what this post is for. 

But it did get me thinking about how far is too far. A previous admin in the main IT dept (maybe 25 to 30 years ago?) had written a custom `passwd` program in C that got put on all the Linux servers to change their LDAP credentials, and when I arrived and saw that was still being used it was one of the first things I fixed (moved to IdM). They had to know it was a bad idea, but management/office politics/something must have forced their hand. I think we can all agree that went too far. But where would you stop and draw the line on IT programming? Is the puppet code that handles our configuration management too much if I wrote a few custom modules to help abstract everything? Is your custom script that automates a crucial task but needs to be maintained too much?

Latest update as of approximately 01:00 UTC, 7 May 2020 is listed below

**Title:** Multiple credential prompts in the Outlook client 

**User impact:** Users may receive repeated credential prompts within the Outlook client. 

**More info:** While we're focused on remediation, users that have access to other protocols such as Outlook on the web or mobile devices can access their email without issue. Additionally, customers who are able to use Modern Authentication may enable it to mitigate impact for affected users. Details on how to enable Modern Authentication can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/enable-or-disable-modern-authentication-in-exchange-online 

**Current status:** We've determined that a recent Exchange Online update contains a code issue which is resulting in repeated credential prompts. We've halted deployment of the build to prevent further spread of impact and we're discussing mitigation steps for this event. We've confirmed that this issue appears to only affect basic authentication configuration users. 

**Scope of impact:** This issue may affect any user that has service-based search or Focused Inbox. Additionally, this issue only affects users that are attempting to connect via basic authentication.

Hoping someone's seen this before or can explain why it might be happening.

We have a number of enterprise apps deployed utilizing Azure AD for identity management.

We have conditional access in place.. normal behavior is that MFA is only required when logging in from a location beyond our country's borders.

We have enabled SSPR (self service password reset) which works fine since it was implemented mid 2019.

In early Feb this year, we enabled the MFA + SSPR converged registration portal. All was well.

In early March, an odd issue started happening. For only 2 of our enterprise apps, every time a user logs in, they get the message saying they are required to complete their security registration, and it directs them to the MFA + SSPR portal to complete it. Virtually all users are already registered, and when they get there it just says setup complete, then they're able to login to the app.

It doesn't matter whether they've already completed their security info or not. They get directed there every time they log in. I've confirmed this with several users who definitely had their security info registered.

This is wierd and it should just be logging straight into the app. They are all in-country when this happens and i've confirmed via AAD logs they are not being flagged by conditional access.

There's no other logs i can find in AAD that explains this behaviour, and its only affected 2 particular applications.

Don’t get me wrong... it had its share of BS, just like any job will have. But the small, 3 person, IT team meshed well together and wasn’t where any work dramas would happen. Which I appreciated greatly. 

I was able to learn a lot there, on a lot of different technologies, with a lot of different vendors. I had to wear the “jack-of-all-trades” hat, which came with its’ own pros &amp;amp; cons. Networking, VoIP, Monitoring/SIEM, Windows, VMware Virtualization, Backups, Cloud platforms... I got to touch and manage it all. It really expand my depth and scope of knowledge in a way that would be hard to replicate.

In the end my new job is giving me a 4 day work week (something I’ve always desired), a sizable jump in pay (just in time for a coming baby), and more opportunities for greater future growth and movement.

The two key takeaways that I would like to share are: 

(1) Get some certifications. I know a lot of people have heavy feelings on both sides of the “are certs worth it” debate. For years I was always ‘meh’ about earning certs. There is a place for knowledge and experience over a  cert. But in the last couple years I’ve started actively pursuing certs and you’d be surprised at the number of potential doors it has opened. I’ve gotten quite a few offers from places, just for having that “silly” piece of paper. I’m talking about learning and knowing a subject matter enough to pass a certification on it. With all the online learning resources out there, it should not be too hard to find some study materials or on-demand labs to help you. 

I feel like you should engage that big heap of gray matter you have and earn a certification. That cert is a tangible asset from a 3rd party which verifies that you know the particular subject matter of what the cert is for. Hell, aim low, if you want! Find an “easy” (that term is relative to your current knowledge level and skill sets) and minimal effort certification you can work on in your down, or off, time. That spark of satisfaction you get after you earn one certification will likely carry you to earning your next one.

(2) Be yourself and make friends. It really is your circle of connections and people you interact with that can pull you forward. I feel like this new job sprouted from a conversation I had a couple years back with the husband of a friend of my wife’s. We got along well (both worked in IT, different roles and industries). When they had a position open, he reached out about the opening. It was a great opportunity. I applied and ultimately got the job.

I recently joined a company where the admin setup DFS and pooched it by ""helping DFS"" by manually copying over files to speed up the process. Now on the Secondary site there is a huge backlog, and dfs is barely working now. I am afraid to destroy DFS and re-set it up without doing a full audit because DFS was setup with Namespace with both sites active/active so there are files in both sites and out of sync.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I wanted to restart from scratch so I did an audit between both systems using robocopy /mir /secfix /timfix /copyall /L  from Site 1 --&gt; Site 2 and from Site 2 --&gt; Site 1.

My findings were quite odd and interesting at the same time, there are tonnes of files that robocopy indicates as ""modified"" but they aren't really modified. I looked at their attributes, timestamp, security settings, file size, and its all identical. To the point that I even ran MD5SUM between files on both sites and the MD5SUM hash was also identical but yet DFS and Robcopy seem to think there is a change.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyway to figure out what both DFS, and robocopy are finding to be modified? Even if it is a program that does comparison between files?

A little background:  Joined the IT world about a year ago and I'm working as a Jr. Sys Admin in a manufacturing setting (4 main plants).  Solid proficiency in the tech, A+ certified, and always looking to learn new skills, tech, etc. 

Now, I had an issue today where a ticket came in about a computer that wasn't working properly, but it didn't come from that computers owner, it came from another user in the factory (receptionist).  Issue was stated in ticket as ""they can't access the pc, keeps kicking them off, can't access email... blah blah.""  Well as this particular PC has only one user and the plant manager forbade anyone from using it besides the person who's job it is to sit at that desk, I responded with ""who is ""they""?  As I understood, this computer is only supposed to have one user and nobody else is supposed to be touching that pc"".  

This was not read in the manner it was written and managed to piss off the receptionist.  She complains to her boss (the plant manager) and my boss gets an chewing out from the plant manager that he wants nothing to do with me and he doesn't want me anywhere near his plant.  Then a bunch more comes out from other workers there, plant floor and supervisors alike, that I'm rude to them and not professional.  All tickets from this plant are to now go through the Sys admin instead of me trying to troubleshoot.  

Now I'll admit, I've had some Customer service skill issues recently (mostly from emails taken out of tone, or a panicked phone call trying to prevent a user from taking down the whole phone network, but I am working on it.  This incident has made me ill.  A full plant not allowing me at their site because the tiny amount of interaction I have with their user base has ruffled some feathers.  I consider myself efficient, the work is normally done early when I make these trips.  I've never heard a single complaint until today when it all avalanched on my bosses desk.  

What do I do?  My boss says we have to fix this with the plant manager but he (the plant manager) apparently complained about me to the president of the company and I am freaking out along side of being livid with the plant who decided they wanted to throw me under the bus even though their facility has never run smoother.  I'm half tempted to play the smiling robot from here on out with these people so I don't run into any more issues.

As a temporary fix to prevent our users from threatening the security of the whole company, I put a wildcard external SharePoint and Sway site block into place in Mimecast.

I have a background in ""computers,"" but system administration is outside of my wheelhouse. I was hoping to be pointed in the direction of some reading material as well as any general advice.

The overall goal is to manage memberships and member access to assets. In few bullet points:

* Collection of member dues is tied to member's continued access to the club and its assets. If payment is overdue, access is automatically suspended.
* Members can access a self-help portal to view their contact info, update payment info, etc
* Members are granted access to assets either by administrative users or peers qualified to grant access. Assets include tools (power controlled by microcontroller), websites and computers

We are a ""pull yourselves by the bootstraps"" sort of club, and so far here is what's in place:

* Using Stripe for payment processing via Stripe's dashboard. Member payment info is initiated via a  Stripe Checkout page and then updates are managed by the Treasurer, by hand.
* FreeIPA on AWS for ""access control."" On the software side it means access to the Mediawiki (also on AWS) via PluggableAuth. We don't have much documentation on the FreeIPA set up and it could probably use a fresh start.
* Physical access control at the club's entrance using a RaspberryPi hooked up to an electric door strike and RFID fob reader. The RPI runs an instance of FreeIPA that is synchronized with the AWS copy. When a fob is scanned, FreeIPA is searched for an active user with same door code and access is granted/denied.
* Members are added/removed to AWS FreeIPA and mailing list via a shell script
* Access to everything else in the club is on the honor system. There are a few Windows machines that we would love to switch to individual log-ins, instead of a shared one
* Most of the infrastructure lives in AWS and we have plenty of AWS credits annually that we would like to use more.
* We have a few Windows server licenses that have not yet been used
* There is a physical server rack in the space, but it's mostly doing nothing other than provide access to the WAN. Could be invested into.

In my limited understanding, it seems that we should set up either Windows AD (locally) or LDAP properly (locally or in AWS) and use that as the database for member info, somehow tying in the local Windows workstations.

I've been told by ""veteran"" admins that it wouldnt work, as Active Directory needs to talk to a Windows DHCP Server to work as it should. But some people say it's not the case anymore, and that it works now.

What is your take on that?

Will computers be able to join the domain?

Is there some mandatory steps I should know to make it work?

We are looking at whether or not is it worth rolling out some sort of seamless SSO for OneDrive for all of our hot seat PCs (about 400) in a school.

Currently we are working from home so the metrics are a bit screwy, and I don't want to ask staff to have to try and fill out a questionnaire because it would both scare them and require them to actually think about what they are using.

Does anyone know if it is possible using O365 to view what client users are accessing OneDrive/SharePoint libraries with.

I assume there must be something somewhere in one of the logs/records but there are quite a lot and I may not have access to everything anyway - would need to talk to my global admin.

258,t3_gel70c,"I've been looking for a way to consistently backup my router, switches, and firewalls. [Solarwinds Cattools](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-cattools) works great for the routers, and firewalls; however, some of the switches just don't work with Cattools. So after hunting the Internet for a bit, I found a solution using a Visual Basic script.

What I did was create a 'switches.txt' file with the IP addresses of the switch(es) I was backing up. Keep in mind, though, that all of the IP(s) in this switches.txt file have to have the same username and password; if they don't, you can create another folders with other switches.txt file and another script, and execute it from that folder.

I tried using '[putty](https://putty.org/)' but I couldn't get putty to accept the passwords using ssh via the vbs script, so I ended up using [kitty.exe](https://download.cnet.com/KiTTY/3000-2155_4-10698301.html). Your mileage may vary.

I put kitty.exe in the C:\\Download\\ folder. If you put it somewhere else, change the script accordingly.

After creating the script(s) I run them in a task scheduler (I use [system scheduler](https://www.splinterware.com/products/scheduler.html)). 

Copy the text below and save it with the .vbs extension, and edit it; point it at the switches you want to backup.

Your mileage WILL vary. You will have to do a little work to get this to work, but the pay off is that you can automate the switch backups

Enjoy.

So  I currently work for a start up and essentially my job is to hire Tech Support people all day. My boss wants me to constantly hire more and more people per week though and I'm finding it difficult to keep up.

So techies of reddit, are tech forums still a thing? Do they allow job posts? If there are specific ones dedicated to this can you point me in the right direction?

I'm trying to figure out what's the best way to allow users to move between laptops and a remote desktop while preserving all or most of their settings, files etc. 

From what I've read, Roaming profiles will roam everything, UE-V will only roam what you ask for it (it was a redditor that posted that, sorry don't remember who). 

UEV sounds great, as my ""users"" are my kids in the scenario, and they have O365 through their school district. All of their schoolwork is saved on Teams/OneDrive/Sharepoint. 

But for things that are local, I can use one of the solutions above. UEV seems to be dead or dying? Looks like it's been in v2.1 for a while, with little to no update on documentation. Wondering if Microsoft abandoned this for the whole ""sign in with Microsoft to sync""

I also saw some where about setting up WorkFolders and folder redirecting to those. But would you redirect something like APPDATA to that? 

All of the threads that I saw were from the past (1 to 2yrs old). Has everyone just given up and used Microsoft accounts to sync things to the big data center in the sky? 

My kids don't have assigned laptops, and frequently switch. I also have a remote desktop that they can log into. Ideally, their settings/profiles would migrate from the laptop to the rd and vice versa.

I wondered if anyone had any ideas for me; I have a server which is refusing to backup due to the state of the C:\\ drive. (Our backup software does various checks before it starts)

There's definitely something wrong with the C: Drive:

* Every time the server boots it attempts a CHKDSK, which never seems to resolve
* Using Contig.exe I found the C:\\ disk very fragmented
* FSutil states the disk is in a dirty state
* Defrag isn't possible, I guess because it has this dirty state set and I guess you don't want to defrag a dirty disk anyway? Might just cause more issues?
   * Just for clarification the C:\\ doesn't appear in the drag GUI and command line doesn't allow it either

317,t3_geop7b,"I work(ed) for a semi-autonomous part of a company, which recently got sold off to another company. 

Everyone's jobs are being transferred to the new company, but a lot of us (possibly the majority) are not getting a proper job offer, just a 12 month contract. We have all been told that the intention is to hire us after this, but several of the people in the same group as me did get instant full offers.

What bothers me is that the people who did get the full offer work largely with our on-site stuff, while those of us who got contracts are remote employees who work more with AWS, me included. (The new company has a fair number of remote employees so I'm not worrying specifically about the intention being to get rid of all of our remote people, but more if it's targeted towards AWS people.) Our AWS infrastructure is on the complicated side and I'm the longest-standing employee who works primarily with it and probably have the best idea of how stuff fits together.

If the contract actually paid contractor money, I might be fine with it as I could actually save some up to cover a gap at the end, but right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck, and I'm getting paid basically the same with just a small increase which really isn't more than the inflation increase I would have otherwise got if my job had stayed the same (proper increases and bonuses were suspended due to the pandemic). In general I'm underpaid, while I like the culture and the people and it's too early to tell what the new company is like and how that might change, so I'm putting that aside for now.

I'm a bit wary of some changes that are clearly coming down the pipeline (e.g. they're Micro$oft Everything while we're largely open source based and free to use tools that don't suck), but what really bothers me is the 12 month contract. I work remotely largely because I'm stuck in a city that has almost no tech industry short of a few development sweatshops (local people who don't know shit about the tech industry love to claim there is one here, but there really isn't), and I don't want to end up screwed over a year from now having to compete with the whole country for remote jobs at short notice, as the only local jobs I can do are either monkey work for a third of the pay, or suit-wearing megacorps who would reject me as soon as I walked into the room. I'm a medium company person, who needs the kind of place where I can look how I want and have autonomy to use the right tools for the job, while still getting paid money I can actually live on.

Does anyone else have experience with being moved to a contract? Is this a red flag or something more common than I thought, and if so, why give full offers to some people and not others?

I'm not planning to bail immediately, but I'm definitely considering at least keeping my options open because while the writing isn't quite on the wall yet, I can see how it could end up there very quickly.",Permanent job to 12 month contract in an acquisition - thoughts?,r/sysadmin,0.38,0,14,{}

I hope to connect Outlook to both a G Suite account and an Exchange account.

I installed [G Suite Sync for Microsoft Outlook](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gssmo/) and connected it successfully.

I closed and reopened Outlook, but the application stops and spins at the splash logo (even after waiting 10-15 minutes).

If I add the accounts in reverse (Exchange first, and G Suite next), the G Suite Sync application creates a new Outlook profile for the G Suite account. This requires me to toggle between the two profiles and defeats the whole purpose of trying to consolidate in Outlook.

Hoping everyone is safe and sound during the lockdown!

Linux newbie here (apologies for any incorrect terms or lack of verbose diagnostics), wondering if anyone out there can provide me a helping hand or steer me in the right direction.

**Background** \- We have a couple of Windows Server 2012 R2 file server running DFS (n and r), with multiple DFS shares. Our Linux estate mounts these shares using SMB with multi-user mode via NTLMSSPI. The idea being, the mount config is in fstab with creds of an account that simply just does the mounting. Whilst pam\_cifscreds passes the end-user credentials to the kernel keyring automatically at login. All this config is deployed and managed via puppet5.

OS = Ubuntu 18.04uname - a = 4.15.0-96-lowlatency #97-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Wed Apr 1 04:10:58 UTC 2020 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

Fstab:

    //fileshare/Share      /net/f  cifs    vers=3.02,multiuser,_netdev,sec=ntlmsspi,file_mode=0750,dir_mode=0755,credentials=/etc/samba/credentials    0       2

**Problem a)** User has created a service that simply does a kinit for a service account and then runs a ls on a mounted SMB shared /net/f to test mount reliability. It runs every hour to continuously poll the mount. (Now there could just be something wrong with this test itself but bear with me). It works for a short while but fails thereafter with:

    &lt;hostname&gt; run_test.sh[75853]: ls: cannot access '/net/f/Apps': Permission denied  

If I su as the service account running that script, and do a ls myself. /net/f, is there. Once I re-run the service after my su/ls, it resolves for a few hours. Then it fails again with the same error.

It's lead me to believe that it's the kernel keyring that's not right here?

The kern.log shows this log:

    [106415.123493] audit: type=1400 audit(1588686578.583:1933): apparmor=""ALLOWED"" operation=""open"" profile=""/usr/sbin/sssd"" name=""/run/systemd/users/835005388"" pid=64837 comm=""krb5_child"" requested_mask=""r"" denied_mask=""r"" fsuid=0 ouid=0
    [106415.158697] audit: type=1400 audit(1588686578.618:1934): apparmor=""ALLOWED"" operation=""file_mmap"" profile=""/usr/sbin/sssd"" name=""/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/krb5/plugins/authdata/sssd_pac_plugin.so"" pid=64837 comm=""krb5_child"" requested_mask=""m"" denied_mask=""m"" fsuid=835005388 ouid=0

**Problem b)**  (Different host but running the same mount config via fstab and SMB) Related to drive mounts again. We have another service account which isn't able to ls the same /net/f as above, but can get to the other mounts whilst we su. When we try to ls on /net/f, we get:

    ls: reading directory '.': Permission denied

I've tried to update the cifscreds details manually, a reboot, umount/mount. Still no luck. I think both issues are linked.

We've been using SMB 3.02 + NTLMSPPI previously but it was without the multi-user mode. The break glass solution for me is to revert the multi-user mode back to just using the mount creds as the access creds. I don't believe this is the right way to resolve it as it leaves a security hole.

My plead for help is two fold, how do others implement this? Secondly, what are we doing wrong? This was put in by our previous Linux Admin (not claiming to be one, just check my username).

Should I look into autofs and steer away from fstab? Or should I move from NTLMSPPI to Kerberos (previous admin said he couldn't find a solution for when Kerberos tickets expired as the kernel wasn't able to regenerate them, which led to shares timing out).

I appreciate any help, thanks for looking at my post :)

331,t3_ge6yhu,"I do trust my work, I don't trust my memory.

This is going to be long, I apologize but right now I feel I have to talk about it to get past this stomach sick feeling. I'm stressed to my max right now, even thought of arguments about how this situation happened and how I'm only partly responsible.

I spent the last 3 months planning a reconfiguration of my NAS where my backups are stored. I had drive failures that was popping up at a freakishly high rate, 5 drives failed within 3 months. All drives were less than a year old.

I started prep to move my annual backups to make room for at least 3 weeks of backups so I can do my move with as little stress as possible.

I have 5 weeks worth of backups off site so I was covered for those, but I had no where to put my annual backups. I made room on our old retired nas systems and was able to move everything but this year's annual backup. I had to break those down in half and move half of the set of backup files onto one server and the other half onto another server. Needless to say I barely had room on 4 different devices for my backups, but I managed.

I was hoping to spend a week looking at the NAS and figuring out how to rebuild the raid the wy I wanted because 5/12 drives failed literally within 3 months, haven't figured out yet if it was bad drives or if something else killed the drives with the config. I was not expecting that, I had 4 drives set aside for failure and up until 2 weeks ago I still had 1 spare drive to keep me alive before all spares were used. We had no stand by drives because we couldn't afford it.

Well I couldn't wait any longer the day I decided to rebuild the nas for backups, the final drive gave out. Not too worried about it because I had already moved everything over to good locations.

Today I spent hours rebuilding the NAS and locating all of the old backups to move over but I couldn't find half of our annual backups. I panicked so bad, I'm feeling so sick to my stomach right now.

I made an emergency run to the office because I needed to know if I messed up or just being paranoid. Plugged one of the old nas in by USB, I wasn't expecting that it could hold the data that I was looking for but, there it was. All of the backups that I needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am heart racing, sweat pouring out of me, sick to my stomach from stress. I had a good idea that I'm not that reckless, I definitely wouldn't do something like that without making sure I had everything in order first. But in the moment, logic is out the window and panic sets in.

Thank god I spent 3 months working on this and triple checking my work as I went along. I truly think I would have ruined my reputation if I messed this up and most likely out of a job. The lesson I learned, always create a temporary document listing what work you did setting anything up. No matter how big or small the project is, document your work.

Documentation doesn't have to be about policy or procedures, sometimes having a progress log on your work even if you plan on deleting once the work is done can save your mental. I did not mess up today and its going to take me a while to come down off this stress.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Spent 3 months planning a project that would prevent a crisis with backups. Shortly after my prep was finished I hit breaking point and had to enact my plan before I had a chance to inventory where I had stored the backups. Rebuilding the backup system today and moving backups back to it, got a scare that I deleted 4 sets of year-end backups. Max panic set in and I went to my office to plug in our old backup system because I knew some files were moved there but I didn't expect all of them. Turns out all of the files I needed were on the old system that wasn't plugged in and if I had taken inventory of those backups then I wouldn't have panicked.

&amp;#x200B;

Also before anyone criticizes me about documentation, I had documentation on everything else for this project. I had documented how I was rebuilding the raid, total storage, number of spare drives, model numbers for each drive, even the names of folders for the file system where the backups would be kept. Everything but where the backups were stored temporarily, I didn't get a chance to do that before I had to dive into the rebuild.

346,t3_geec6i,"Hey there,

First things first the details of the server,etc:

Windows Server 2003 (Basically used as a network drive only)   
Watchguard xtm 5 series (unsure of model, was configured by previous ISP to allow for simultaneous internet connections, it's no longer needed but for some reason have constant issues with internet when trying to remove it.)  
Vodafone NBN Modem  
few netgear network switches  
2 hot spots  


How the server is connected:  


Server PC plugs into wall socket, it's sent to another socket which then goes into the watchguard,

In the watchguard you have 3 cables (first cable is the server cable from the socket, second cable is the WAN cable from the NBN modem to the watchguard and the third cable is the uplink for our 2 hotspots connected by a PoE.

Now I would personally like to remove the watchguard altogether as it was initially just meant to load balance 2 adsl connections because we were unable to obtain any other type of internet until recent, however when unplugging the watchguard and simply plugging server into any of the switches with the modem and PoE cable doesn't seem to allow anything to work, plugging it back into the watchguard then somehow makes it all work? (this is not the case now as the TCP/IP details have been reset on the server and it's having communication issues), it was config'd remotely and the ISP won't give me anything in regards to how to to configure it myself or anything similar so it just sits there without any knowledge of how to use it or how to remove it.  


How the issue started:

Today I had some issues with a printers IP address stating that the IP address that it was using was already taken, so I had gone into our windows server 2003 and checked the DHCP and DNS to see if there was any devices taking the address, I could see that no device had taken its IP address or leased it, so I simply reset the printer assuming it would detect that no other device has the IP and simply use it but it still kept stating that the IP was in use.

I then went onto the windows 2003 machine and went to command prompt and did a basic flushdns to see if that would work and it didn't appear to do anything so I then did the following commands:

netsh int ip reset  
netsh winsock reset  
ipconfig /release  
ipconfig /renew  


now after this my server attempted to assign new details to its local area connection, it seemed to have deleted the TCP/IP settings that were set for the server to be on a static IP address and I can't remember the exact IP address the server was set to, I remember the gateway and such.

Now after I had done those commands the printer decided that the IP address was now free but then the wireless and all internet connections were lost.  


So far I have a small workaround, however it isn't what I'd like.

To achieve this workaround I set my IP address of the windows 2003 server to the same as the gateway ([192.168.1.250](https://192.168.1.250)) and I am able to achieve internet on some devices by ethernet (a few are limited and unable to get an ip address) as well as wireless however the server itself is unable to access the internet and wireless devices are unable to access the shared drives or print to the printers, so I change the IP address to [192.168.1.252](https://192.168.1.252) (same as the gateway) to see if that allows for any network drive access, the internet access for the Ethernet and wireless connections remain however access to the shared folders and printers are then not working, also windows 2003 server pc constantly spits out that is has an IP address conflict when changed to 1.252.

If I change the IP address to be anything but 1.250 or 1.252 it doesn't give internet or shared drive access to the ethernet or wireless connections. 

Ideally I just want to be able to access my shared network drives via the wireless internet again, but this has been the biggest headcase today all because a printer wanted to claim its ip address was a duplicate.

Now I am without internet to over 90% of the devices in the business and the network drive is only accessible via one computer that is connected via Ethernet.

I am completely at a loss here, any help would be highly appreciated.",IP Address conflicts doing my head in,r/sysadmin,0.43,0,32,{}

Basically, using VEEAM we are taking incremental backups during the week, and full VBK backups on the weekends. These jobs run successfully, and successfully transfer to our Synology NAS for safe storage. We are avoiding HyperBackup as those files are uploaded in a proprietary format and require downloading back to the Synology to be able to restore. Also old backups would never get removed from the HyperBackup system causing Azure storage usage to skyrocket. 

I’ve been attempting to use Rclone from the Synology terminal on the two volumes we store backups to. This works for everything, except our Windows VBK/VIB file which are 5.7TB and 4.1TB respectively. With those file sizes in mind Azure has blob size limits that we seemingly cannot get around. My limited and only very recent experience within this platform is probably rearing it’s ugly head here.

Are there alternatives to using full VBK backups to get around these Azure limitations?

I've verified that the missing servers are receiving the GPO by using gpresult as well as making sure they're added to the correct OU in AD.

I'm thinking about our new disaster recovery room that was very much a disaster. I can't decide on the best way to restore if a VM or virus/cryptolocker got us.

I need some help for my linux server . Basically I have a docker container used as netfwork from other containers. When I put on standby my computer and wake it up this container status will be ""unhealthy"" instead of ""healthy"", so I need to restart it and then all the other containers that will use it.

Now I need to do this with a script but I don't know how to write it

This what this script should do:

    if ([docker ps --filter ""name=vpn""] not contain ""(healthy)"") Then {
        c=0;
        docker restart vpn;
        #restart vpn until it's healthy

382,t3_ge4ngu,"Hi, I'm aware that this question has been asked before on this subreddit and in a few other places (this subreddit's one was a compatibility issue between 512B and 4K sector sizes I believe), and there seems to be about a total of 4 or 5 results of this same problem on google, and all are basically unanswered. Except for the one mentioned on this subreddit, who had an incompatible drive, as in it was not on the LSI Gen2 list of compatible drives. However, in my case it is, and yet it still remains seen as Unconfigured (Good) Unsupported. I'm running an LSI 9260-4i connected to 4 Seagate ST900MM0006 10K.6 SAS drives. And although they are shown to be compatible on the Gen2 compatibility list, ([https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/MegaRAID-SAS-Gen2CompatibilityList](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/MegaRAID-SAS-Gen2CompatibilityList)), the controller refuses to work with the drives, and upon attempting to create a RAID volume, it fails. Even after a firmware update to the latest firmware (circa 2015) it still doesn't work. Now, I thought it could be the fact that on the list of compatible drives, it notes the firmware, and for my drive, it notes firmware A001, however, my drives list firmware 4F08. Could this be it? Surely they can't expect you to have the *exact* same firmware on the list, right? Even if that's so, the date code on my drives says ""15333"" which translates to Feb 16, 2015 when the latest firmware for the controller came out sometime in August of 2015. That seems pretty close in terms of time for them to not support it because it's obsolete. I have put in a ticket with LSI, but they are responding very slowly. Took them about a day for them to respond after putting in the ticket, back with the command to run their logging script, and that was Monday, April 27th. I replied to them with the results on Tuesday, and haven't heard anything since. I also called them, but it went right to voicemail. Maybe they're out for corona? But I did get one response from them so I'm not sure. I've also emailed Seagate to see if maybe the A001 firmware for some reason isn't listed on their site, as after searching for available firmware for my drives, nothing is listed. But, I'm not very optimistic they'll have anything, and they haven't responded. Anyway, any ideas as to what's going on here? [Here's](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jmn6CsXwcu3PqvMDwXYCU4cA2qwsvfEV) a link to the same logs the LSI tech guy asked for.

We have a couple site-to-site VPNs that we use for our customers. We typically provide a set of specifications regarding algorithms and key sizes, but tunnel addressing as always been something unique and negotiated for each customer.

I know this is decided on a case-by-case basis, but when you set up a VPN with an external business (vendor / customer), do you typically provide:  

* The literal IP / Subnets used on your network (providing there's no overlap between both networks)
* A translated internal IP for the traffic to pass through
* A translated external IP for traffic.

We've tried setting up tunnels using a translated internal IP on both sides of the VPN to prevent addressing conflicts, but we typically run into issues with customers not knowing / unable to set up an address translation. This makes me wonder if it's not commonly used.

386,t3_ge223j,"I really have no idea what's happening, here, and I've done everything I can think of to troubleshoot.

SYMPTOMS:
-Machines unable to service logon requests to non-cached profiles.
-Cached profiles' passwords not matching other machines which DO have DC connectivity (usually this is the first symptom).

Okay, it's an issue talking to the DC. Yes and no:

-Can ping domain controller, but cannot resolve through DNS.
-DNS, when it DOES resolve, does so to an external address, which I have tracked down as our marketing firm.
-Some machines work, others do not. It does not appear to be a function of hardware, as far as I can tell.
-Affected machines removed from the domain cannot rejoin (AD DC could not be contacted).
-Affected machines removed from the domain can access the internet and perform normally.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
-Looked at, modified DNS servers, default gateways, etc. Everything seems to be in order. Machines point to DC, DC points to router, router points to outside world (8's)
-DNS Records *look* okay, but this is where my expertise is limited. I've checked the things I've been told to check, and nothing references anything unexpected, but I have no reverse lookup zones (that's never been a problem, before).
-Altered the DCHP scope, which may or may not have anything to do with it. No change to any machine's status.

Troubleshooting I've considered:
-Wipe-and-loading a machine and seeing if the issue persists.
-Blowing away my DNS service and reinstalling it.
-Quietly contemplating the choices I've made with my life.
-Setting the comm closet on fire.

Help me. I'm having a bunch of other issues, but I think they all seem to relate in some way back to this: Printers accessible and inaccessible, depending on the day and their mood, file share requiring and not requiring a password to access (by default it does not, once authenticated), etc.

I realize this is probably basic. I get it, I do. But I want to learn. I've tried to learn. What am I missing?!

Edit: I may not have been especially clear about this detail, but my domain resolving to an external IP address hosted by our marketing firm happens both internally and externally to our network, and that if one were to type companyinternaldomain.com into a browser from anywhere, it would redirect them to companyexternalwebsite.com... Maybe that information is useful, maybe not.

Second Edit: I thought it might be good to help clean this up a bit, and give a little bit of reference material, for definitional purposes.

Internal Domain: internal.com

Internal IP scheme: 10.10.10.

Router: .1

389,t3_ge06aw,"Hi

I'm trying to get Always on VPN working properly, I've been following the guide on the MS website and everything has worked as it should until the very end.

When I'm testing the VPN connection on a windows 10 machine it connects straight away using the local certificate on the machine. The issue I'm having it the fact it's not using the NPS server.

I was under the impression you have the certificates installed and it then connects to the VPN server which then checks your AD account is in the correct group before allowing you to connect. I can turn the NPS server off completely and still connect so it doesn't seem to be doing that check

The authentication provider on the VPN server is set to Radius with the correct details in there

""Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function""

My understanding is that AD hashes (weakly) the credentials, but they're not actually stored. That means we can't meet these requirements, correct? And I assume anyone else on AD also wouldnt be able to; unless there's another control I'm not thinking of?

Anyways, I don't know much about telephony, and I was tasked with figuring out how we could all call from our personal cell phones but have the phone number pop up as our companies number, or at least a generic shared number. From what I can tell our Mitel 5000 phone system can't do this. Is there any online phone bank type service I could use? Basically we want to call from our personal cell phones to a central number, then dial the customers from that number. 

Best part is, I just found out about this a few minutes ago and they want to start making calls today. So I haven't done much other than precursory googling, most of what I am finding that might do it is focused around political calls, much more complicated than we need it to be, and expensive. Any advice/info would be appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks for the info so far, as I am the only one working on this and then will have to train the end users I may just have to go with the google voice option to hide our real numbers, but with no way for a central number.

396,t3_ge0t8u,"**Background:** The Company I work for received new Dell 5400 and 5500s that have intermittent issues connecting to Skype for Business (365) (issue was replicated on multiple versions) on a WiFi connection while working from home connected through our VPN. **Our other laptops from Dell have no issues**. The users that get the issue will either get stuck on the main login screen for Skype on “signing in” or they get passed the sign in screen and just see themselves and everyone else as “**Presence Unknown**” (example [https://filestore.community.support.mic ... b040e2f735](https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0adafef0-7352-4ac7-b004-51b040e2f735))

The laptops have no issues connecting to skype when using a wired Ethernet connection either in the office or at home via VPN. The issue occurs when the user brings their laptop home and connects to their Wi-Fi then to our VPN and tried to sign into skype. This could last up to 90 minutes before finally signing in.

We have already confirmed it is not the VPN causing this issue as our network team ran some tests and confirmed it.We have tried clearing the SIP profile, other user accounts, other Wi-Fi networks, updating the Skype version and nothing worked.

What Temporarily Worked: We thought we had it when we updated the Intel 9560 Wireless Drivers as it worked initially, but a few days to a week later the issue returned. Going into the **Device Manager Advanced Settings** for the Wireless card and changing the **Mimo Power Save Mode** to **Dynamic SMPS** then back to Auto SMPS actually fixes the issue and lets the sign into Skype, but only for a few days as well.

Skype for Business is the only application that is affected by this on our new systems. It seems that the WiFi Card, Skype, and our VPN are not working together and it is becoming harder to pinpoint the issue.

We thought the whole batch was flawed, and tier 1 support at Dell actually wanted us to send them back. But we pursued the issue and got to a higher tier of support where we were informed that what we thought was a bug or problem is actually by design and part of the energy star/energy efficiency feature of the laptop.

Essentially, immediately after booting up the laptop, while it is at the login screen, it will sleep after 1 minute. If you log into Windows, the laptop will sleep after 4 minutes. You can not override this with the Window 10's power settings. So if you set the laptop to never sleep, or to sleep after a half hour, it will still zonk out at 4 minutes.

Sleeping is baked into the hardware, and there is no way dictate when the laptop sleeps, is what we were told. There is a setting in the BIOS where you can completely block sleep all together. But that does exactly what it says, it removes sleep as an option completely.

Have any of you run into this? It is making remote support a real pain. We usually set our Win10 machines to ""never"" sleep when plugged in. But now they go night-night after 4 minutes no matter what. Which means we have a 4 minute window to jump on a machine remotely and catch it before it goes to sleep. It's hard to impossible in most situations.

I am currently working on a physical authentication factor (MFA) based on location for cloud hosted services.  


The idea is to authenticate access to certain services using a classical password, and a defined location (e.g. company premises). The location-based authentication factor works by using a physical authenticator whose location is determined by one or more beacons placed in the premises of a company.  


This technology would allow staff to access certain services (can be critical) only from defined, trusted locations  
It could also ease the management of cloud access for short-term collaborators (e.g. visiting partners from another company, consultants…) by granting an access which is only valid in the company’s premises.

Option 1: on same server where is instance of Owncloud, add 2 hard disks and configure RAID 1 with mdadm on them to be used as storage. rsync backups would be performed daily on second machine + weekly backup.
PROS: Simpler to setup, network is not a factor

CONS: More prone to hardware failure, if server itself somehow fails everything would need to be rebuilt on separate server.

Option 2: use 2 additional servers and create GlusterFS volume with replica 2 + arbiter volume that would be on server where Owncloud instance would be. There will also be geo-replication, daily, weekly or most likely both.

PROS: more resistant to hardware failure, even if whole storage server fails there is other server. If Owncloud server itself fails, I only need to restore backup and re-mount Gluster volume, actual data is intact. Easier to scale up if needed, and most likely it will be needed.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking about going into Consulting/Contract work and trying to decide what is the best option.

Can anybody suggest / tell their experiences with this type of work.  I used to work at the main company that Option 1 has the contract for so I personally know all the vested parties there.

Option 1:

Work directly for company that has the contract.  You are on their payroll and they handle the taxes and what not but I would be required to get insurance (ugghhhhh) .  Less money per hour plus still having to shop for insurance on my own.

Option 2: 

Form and LLC or independent company that the company above would contract the LLC to do the work.  More money per hour but also at the whim of the contract holder as well as doing all the taxes and making sure that you have all the paperwork/other items needed to not owe Uncle Sam boat loads of money come the end of the year.

However, this was a disaster since we massively underestimated the amount of disk space a WSUS server requires. Also, without careful configuration it downloads a lot more than needed. Finally, we were never using it in the way intended, that is controlling who gets which update when - we just had no time to set up a test group, but instead approved all updates immediately.

Im planning on migrating my CA to a new version of windows.  I am pretty much aware of the process involved, however I have been wondering how the CA registers itself.

When i uninstall the CA role on the old server and then install the CA role on the new server is it just a simple case that AD will update itself and all clients will know where to look for certificates or am I missing something obvious.

467,t3_gdetq0,"Hi all,

Little backstory:
I've been working at a ig company for 3 years now. I was hired as an application administrator and made my way to ""Linux System Administrator"" which is my official title now. I'm a self-taught admin, I've loved sys stuff, programming and PC in general since my teenage years. I've written some C# and Python libraries and utilities and I'm an active homelabber.

I was hired when my company decided to form a ops team to help the devs on inner source project to manage all the ops side of thing so basically managing and deploying server, automating deployment and configuration with Chef, monitoring and bringing front line support for users (within the company). 

Fast-forward to now, market is trending a lot toward devops workflow. We are currently working with devs on a development platform project. As other apps, we are in charge of providing the monitoring. Since this app is hosted on Kubernetes, we can't monitor with an agent like we used to, so we are instead discussing how to forward alerts to MS Teams using a webhook. This needs a forwarder to be set to receive alerts and forward them to the needed channel.

I did a POC on a dev cluster of ours and have a working solution I presented today. The solution works for them, but my issue here is that it was pushed by their IT project manager that I (our team) should be the one making the integration to their platform.

I've spoken with one of the devs to have an idea of what were the implications of that. It involves, in my opinion, quite a bit of dev, learning jsonnet (I already know the basics but this is advanced usage) to generate the manifests and fit all these into the makefiles they use to deploy. I think I can reasonnably pull it in about a week, considering all the learning needed and that I can't put 100% of my time on it since some important ticket will come once in a while.

Now, I'm someone who really likes to learn new technologies, languages and such. I taught myself programming, scripting and other techs like Kubernetes, but I think this goes out of my scope. I spoke with my collegues about it(we are a team of 3 guys), they all agree with me but think I might as well do it to prove that what will take me a week would take one of their devs a few hours.

Their(the dev team) point is that to be able to support the platform correctly, I should understand how pieces are interacting with each others.

I find this to be a valid point, but I fail to see where the integration of components fits my job description and my expertise. I've approached my manager about it before and he was agreeing with me but it seems to be a recurring theme, and the line is hard to draw. I don't want to look like the guy who doesn't want to improve, as it's totally not the case but I fear setting a precedent.

Essentially it is a server for Exchange Management (management console/powershell) which seems like overkill.

Our exchange server hosts no mailboxes and provides no mail routing/relaying at all.

493,t3_gddwr1,"Got a weird issue that so far I haven't been able to find a solution to. As a bit of background, here is the situation:

My company is trying to implement an application for web content filtering, currently we are in the testing phase of deployment. The application is capable of looking at AD security groups and from those applying different filter groups set up in the application console. The way the application gathers information on which group the logged on user is a part of is by scraping the results for the command ""gpresult /r"". Now for the fun part...

Since all our users are working from home right now, they need to connect to a VPN before they are actually connected to the company domain and pull up-to-date group membership for the user account. They can only connect to the VPN after they log into their computer. Because group membership is only pulled to the computer on user login, and the computer must be able to reach out to a domain controller to get updated group membership, the results from ""gpresult /r"" does not include updated group membership. Because the group membership is not updated in those results, the application is not applying any web filter policies to the machine.

So with that, here is what I have tried so far:

From what I could find, group membership is exclusively update on user login, and only if the computer is able to reach out to a domain controller for updated group membership at the time of login. I have confirmed that this is true through logging in on one account, connecting to the VPN, switching users, and logging in to a separate account while on the VPN. When running a gpresult /r under these circumstances, everything works fine.

HOWEVER, there are people that suggest there is a way to get group membership to refresh AFTER logging in. The methods for doing so include using the commands ""gpupdate /force"", ""klist /purge"", and by killing explorer.exe and starting it again running as the user. Unfortunately, every combination and method that I have used with any of these methods does not update the group membership listed in ""gpresult /r""

So with all that said, I have two questions if any of you fine IT professions know.

Where exactly does ""gpresult /r"" gather its data on the group membership of the logged on user? Is it somewhere in the registry, a Kerberos ticket, or somewhere else?

Is there any way not mentioned that can refresh the user's group membership AFTER the user has already logged in and connected to VPN?",VPN and Group Membership,r/sysadmin,0.71,3,13,{}

4. In DNS/SPF I've ensured that the sending IP address has been added in an 'include' statement.
5. In [protection.office.com/antispam](https://protection.office.com/antispam) I've ensured that the bulk email threshold is set to '7' which is the default.

7. Mail is passing the SPF check
8. User has no special transport rules in place that might cause the issue

Despite  all that, the email gets sent, received by our system, bypasses the  spam filter, gets an SCL rating of 6 and is immediately routed to  Quarantine.

The document above states the following:

To do a controlled validation of hybrid Azure AD join on Windows current devices, you need to:

1. Clear the Service Connection Point (SCP) entry from Active Directory (AD) if it exists
2. Configure client-side registry setting for SCP on your domain-joined computers using a Group Policy Object (GPO)
3. If you are using AD FS, you must also configure the client-side registry setting for SCP on your AD FS server using a GPO

525,t3_gche63,"I've been waffling on whether or not to post this, but in the past month, I received news that one of the contractors working on a project with me had passed away. This was after about 2 weeks of radio silence where we really weren't sure that had happened. Due to privacy concerns, I'm not sure what befell him, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. His name was common enough that checking obituaries hasn't really helped either. While I didn't know him all that well personally, I wanted to share how I knew him professionally. We'll call him Bill.

Bill joined the project a few months ago which entailed upgrading all of a client's Server 2008 machines and my role was as an advisor who knew the most about the client's environment. The project was described to him of just doing the engineering of performing the upgrades and maybe working with users or vendors, but the reality was much different. The client didn't know their environment well and it would fall to us to discover all their servers, validate the hardware, determine applications/function, confirm that with the application owner, plan out an upgrade path, and then perform the actual work. Despite a couple of grumbles, Bill took it in stride and took on a more leadership role without being asked.

He helped us come up with how we were going to document everything, assisted the other contractors, came up with email templates, always worked on improving processes, and setup a software repository with ISOs and installation media for us to work out of. He rolled out a slew of scripts and tools he had used on previous projects such as the MAP tool and was able to use that to help supplement the information that we did have. He helped clean up their AD by removing all old DCs/metadata, upgraded all existing DCs, cleaned up their RDS licensing infrastructure, actually setup a KMS server and corrected all of the wrong product keys, uplifted their domain functionality, and moved them to DFSR for replication. All of this really fell into a gray area as far as the scope of the project, but Bill knew the importance of having a healthy environment to go into and was all about best practices. Honestly, I'm not sure any of those things would have happened if it hadn't been for him and was in addition to all the upgrades and decommissions he performed. I was never concerned I'd have to double-check his work and really appreciated his help with the project.

Bill understandably had some frustrations that he expressed to me and I know it caused him some stress and anxiety. The client's environment and ""best practices"" can't be used in the same sentence which didn't sit well with him. A lot of the things you might take for granted just aren't in place and he was constantly hitting roadblocks. I did my best to commiserate and make sure that he knew I appreciated him, but I knew it bothered him just the same. I had grown used to and somewhat blind to it having worked with the client for so long.

I guess I just wanted to share how much I appreciated him. He was a man who took pride in his work, was always willing to help, and was always looking to improve things. My only hope is that this project wasn't a contributing factor to his passing. I wouldn't think that it was affecting him too bad, but I just can't be sure.

I have checked to make sure both servers can access the internet testing site, and retrieve the txt file successfully - for all intents and purposes the machines SHOULD show as online.

I have tried so many things now - including disabling IPV6 (which seemed to work for a bit until the problem returned a few days later).  
I have also tried resetting winsock and performing the netsh int ip reset commands (which didn't help at all).

For whatever reason, when it was configured only 1 HDD was installed on the RAID Controller. Unfortunately my knowledge of RAID is lacking so much that I cant even remember what RAID mode I must have set the controller in to support just 1 disk. 

Anyway, we now have a duplicate disk to add to the array, however I am a bit lost on how I would go about this.

Is it as simple as:

1/ Physically add disk
2/ Boot into bios
3/ Reconfigure RAID controller to RAID 1.
4/ Now does RAID controller handle the duplication for the first time.

Or is there something I am missing, does RAID need to be configured on blank drives??

Sorry if I am asking  stupid questions, I am just trying to cover all bases before I even think about making the trip into the office to do this work.

TLDR: Can I add second disk to a RAID controller with only 1 disk currently and configure it to mirror the data? If so, got any tips?? Or is it easy peasy?",Adding HDD and reconfiguring RAID,r/sysadmin,0.54,1,4,{}

As we move to dropping off donated smart phones, tablets, and laptops in nursing homes this week, we are met by a few issues.

559,t3_gcmd38," TLDR: outsourcing can go very wrong without proper vetting and working with the IT department. Its best used sparingly in niche support situations for things your business can't manage not for cost cutting purposes.

This is going to be a very long post but my recent experience should stand as a warning to IT managers about outsourcing. I'm not totally against it in certain situations, I tend think it can work in two scenarios. When an IT team doesn't have the expertise or resources to do something cost effectively, I don't think it’s bad to outsource it but it should be a partnership just like any other vendor. The other situation is when a business is clueless, numerous people on this sub reddit have encountered a situation where they're the first real IT person, a bad MSP left a business out to dry, or you're taking over from a hostile and/or incompetent solo admin. 

I've used the same outsourcing companies for the last 5 years. One out of Bangladesh are a smaller family business less than 200 people, they invest in their staff, and from the get go the internal IT team was in control. It was well understood that we brought them onto support us not compete or replace us. The other company is a five person web developer shop out of Slovakia that handles our main web site it freed up resources from working on graphics and front end web requests. The relationship works and we've expanded our services with them as needed. 

This is in stark contrast to my recent experience with a large vampire IT consulting/outsourcing company. My company is large enough that IT teams become silos and have separate IT managers. One IT manager who previously worked for this vampire company made enough noise that he got approval to experiment with outsourcing the business unit he ran. Three and half months later they got booted for failing to provide adequate support

In my opinion I think the now former IT manager and vampire project managers did not really understand how you would operate an IT department or have situational awareness. They put way too much emphasis on ""metrics"" and cost cutting so they could get their bonus. I think they took full advantage of decision makers not being technical and made promises that were not realistic. Unfortunately for them this behavior lost them a customer we're not Barclays large but losing thousands of dollars does not bode well for them. 

Here's a lay down of all their warning signs.

1. They insisted on rushing through the takeover with no transition period

2. No information gathering was conducted by the vampires. They didn't ask exiting employees about their day to day job or for documentation. (I wound up doing this independently bribing people with pizza and drinks to get information because I suspected their failures would eventually fall back to the internal IT teams)

3. Competent IT people from the vampire company who were initially part of the project were either removed for pushing back or must have asked to be reassigned. Perfect example is day one of the hand off the vampires would be handling a particular support desk. An engineer brought up this wasn't plausible because they wouldn't have access to all the systems, and didn't have domain accounts yet. This person was no longer involved in the project after that conference call.

4. Vampire staff were extremely rigid on what they could and could not do. Everything is hidden behind bureaucracy and ticket tennis. Any issue requires unnecessary steps and people getting on a conference call. People treated the calls like echo chambers constantly asking the person next to them for guidance or permission to do something. This sometimes would go on for days. Laughably in one instance after my team discovered a security bug, a vampire joined a call huffing and puffing domineeringly telling a pm that my team needed to join the conference call to approve a change. I had to stifle laughter as I pointed out that we originally started the phone call and opened the support ticket to implement a patch because her team controls the maintenance of the application.

The final warning is kind of a story in itself but I think it’s worth mentioning what actually got this company fired. This business unit had a mainframe administrator who was part of the layoff let’s call him Popeye Doyle. Popeye Doyle had 40 years on the job, only career he's ever had. The day he finds out about the layoff he goes to HR and says I'm not interested in being out sourced or applying for a job at the vampire company. He told them I've maintained the mainframe without interference for years and without a problem. Either we work something out were I remain an employee of the current company or today is my last day I will retire rather than be outsourced. The vampires and the IT manager don't even meet Popeye Doyle half way. I know most of the time outsourcing decisions are made independently of IT and it’s out their control but I've been the primary technical person responsible for preventing/resolving several potential IT disasters in my tenure here. So I have some clout with execs. I warned the CISO and CFO that the vampires were flirting with disaster by firing Popeye Doyle and they needed to cover every square inch of their ass and plan accordingly if they wanted to survive the blast radius. I did my best to sound the alarm with the vampires that they were making a huge mistake. Eventually I dropped all civility in my emails sending something along these lines of: 

*“You guys have no choice but to come to a work agreement with Popeye Doyle, we cannot support this technology, we do not have a support person, I haven't seen evidence vampire company has a resource either, we don't know what core services are on that mainframe or how one would even logon. Frankly if something went wrong and we needed to get a consultant I'm not sure where we could find one, and how soon a consultant could realistically travel to fix the problem with the pandemic ongoing.”* The Vampire's response was so funny I printed it out and tapped it on a wall in my home office.

*"" Hello Lemmy Caution, you'll find that Vampire company has a lot of experience on these handover projects I know there’s always lot of friction and concern initially but we strive ourselves on providing customers with the best resources and you'll soon see we can provide more with less""*

You can imagine how this went. We were already not happy with the service we were getting but then Con Edison in New York accidentally drilled too deep into the street during maintenance and cut power to our building for almost two full days. Not a big deal we just an organized a shut down when it became obvious the outage would last longer than the UPS batteries. Except for the first time in 40 years we didn't have Popeye Doyle there to restart the mainframe. Turns out those mainframes contained a payroll system, payment process system, and a record application for a certificate program we issue anyone could call us and ask if we could validate that a person completed this certificate program. Once it became obvious we could be facing fines and serious trouble from the certificate issuing board the vampires went into full blown panic mode. They actually tried sending email blasts all over their global operation to try and find someone who could fix it. They brought in several consultants from other sections of the vampire operation but couldn't fix it. The full outage lasted seven days until they caved and called Popeye Doyle who basically got a down payment on a beach house somewhere in Pacifica, California for fixing the issue. This outage got the IT manager fired and the service agreement canceled apparently there’s a clause about the vampires being responsible for monetary loss &amp; errors/omissions but most importantly my company learned an expensive lesson on bad IT management/outsourcing.",Encountered IT Outsourcing Bad Practices Recently,r/sysadmin,0.95,144,80,{}

&amp;#x200B;

Situation: I have a Primary Domain Controller (2012 r2) that holds all the fsmo roles and its dying.

I have a handful of other vm domain controllers of which only 1 remains intact. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some research I realized the the fastest and headache-free way of saving this situation would be to transfer the fsmo roles of the physical domain controller to the surviving Virtual DC. Then spin up new dc's from scratch and let them replicate of this new fsmo king. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I plan to accomplish this: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transfer fsmo roles from the phsyical DC to the existing virtual DC. 
2. Demote physical DC
3. Instead of restoring VM DC's just create new DC's and have them pull the data from the VM now holding the fsmo roles.

&amp;#x200B;

Im interested in created a solution that consists of three parts

\-AD as a user source

\-Ansible as a configuration management engine

\-CentOS7 devices as clients that need users

&amp;#x200B;

I want to find a way that ansible can pull user information from, whether it be a secure file or a saml handoff where the user details originate from AD that can then be pushed to the CentOS7 devices as local users. I would like to not be able to reverse the user credentials they do not matter to me. Its more of a way to create a centralized user management system without LDAP or AD as the client cannot allow it.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to extract the password hashes from AD and securely offload them to the clients through Ansible?

Installing a CA-less FreeIPA server (on Linux) with self-signed certificates: feasible?

# Answer (for [FreeIPA server Ubuntu 18.04 package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/net/freeipa-server) install) = ""yes""

After generating `root_or_intermediate_CA.pem`, `ipa_http.p12` ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS\_12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) ) and feeding these files into the following `ipa-server-install` command, we have a *working* (confirmed in our environment) [CA-less FreeIPA server](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V3/CA-less_install) on Ubuntu 18.04... with the following workarounds to correct FreeIPA-on-Ubuntu-18.04 problems:

***FreeIPA bug workarounds*** *(for this system contexts; see versions below)*:

1. Prior to running `ipa-server-install`: [downgrade python's pyasn1 and pyasn1-modules](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyasn1/+bug/1785157).  ([Apparently fixed in FreeIPA 7.4.1](https://pagure.io/freeipa/issue/7685#comment-533776); FreeIPA 4.6.90 is currently packaged with Ubuntu 18.04.4 per system info below.)
2. After running `ipa-server-install`:

* `sudo chmod 775 /var/lib/krb5kdc` (per [this bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/freeipa/+bug/1772447))
* *Optional:* `sudo chmod o+r /var/lib/ipa-client/pki/*.pem`  (apparently needed only when NOT running CA-less FreeIPA)

The `--dirsrv-pin=` and `--http-pin=` paraemters, with no value after the equal sign, appear to be required to signal `ipa-server-install` that the private keys embedded in the `.p12` file have no password/PIN protection. Note also that the `dirsrv` and `http` cert parameters both read the *same* `.p12` file.

    $ ipa-server-install            \
    --unattended                    \
    --dirsrv-cert-file=ipa_http.p12 \
    --http-cert-file=ipa_http.p12   \
    --dirsrv-pin=                   \

On one server it works without a problem and previous shares was configured like this already. On the other server, I have created exact same folders with the same permission and the same group/members but it says that access is denied.

I also have created test folders to test it: Share permission is on ""Everyone"" with full access. NTFS permission is not inherited. Administrator group and SYSTEM have full control on ""This folder, subfolders and files"".

However, the same configuration does work on the second file server with the same OS and updates. Even with new created test folders.

98% of the time, the folder is created properly with the user's login name. However, 2% of the time, a folder is created in the Users folder named %username%, once this is created, other users logging in get errors when the script runs regarding folder already being created and permissions adjusted. 

The second circumstance I have seen this is when creating a new user in AD and copying another users profile. The original profile has a Home folder assigned where originally the path was established using the %username% variable. The User profile created creates a folder named %username% instead of using the users logon name.

What I'm try to do is maximize data transfer rates between two single Windows Server 2016 servers.

The servers have 4 x 1Gb network ports, Windows Server 2016 is installed on 2 SSDs in RAID1.  The SSDs are supposed to support up to 6Gbps transfer rates.  I've tried creating NIC teams with lbfoadmin as well as Switch Embedded Teaming.  Using these limits single host to single host transfers to 1Gbps.  (Though it does allow 4 x 1Gbps transfers if they are to 4 separate hosts).  I've also tried letting the 4 NICs operate independently, not in a team, and let SMB3 multichannel and RSS handle the transfers.  This has had the best results so far, even though each NIC only transferred around 600Mbps for some reason.  Unfortunately the network adapters do not support RDMA so I can't take advantage of that.

From what I've read the networking options will have the same limitation of NIC teaming.  LAG, etc, will permit multiple 1Gbps transfers but the max between two hosts is 1Gbps.

I'm not entirely sure this is the right sub to post this question, if not: please ignore :) I've tried my luck in r/ProWordPress, but got stuck there, as it is a server-specific issue.

I am a web developer, and I've rebuilt the website for a scientific institute here in the Netherlands. It is a WordPress website, where I've built a fully customized back end with Advanced Custom Fields Pro ( [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) ).

This works great in my dev environment. However, after migration to the institute's server, Advanced Custom Fields can not save / update any field data. ACF support has helped me as much as they could, escalating the issue to the plugin developer, and his final findings were this:

""I have added some code to the ACF PRO plugin that will log out information during the ""save\_post"" action. This action should be triggered in two AJAX calls, however, on this site, it is only triggered once.

This explains why ACF is not able to update it's metadata.

As this issue only exists on a specific server, I believe it is safe to say that there is a ""security"" trigger or something similar at play preventing that 2nd AJAX call.""

Everything I tried seemed to not saturate the pipe very much and ultimately settled in on using multiple instances \`rsync\` to perform parallel transfers that seems to almost do the job.

This got me wondering: *are there competing tools with \`rsync\` that will automatically perform a parallelized / concurrent transfer for data?*

Even with this manually parallelized transfer of data there are always some variable children folders that end up having significantly more data than others and these only end up transferring at fractional speeds with \`rsync\` and thus the bandwidth saturation doesn't hold for the last hour or so of the transfer and if this weren't the case the window would be satisfied.

Not sure if an accounting software or database would be better (obviously the accounting for manufacturing I was using involved a database in the background), and I'm not sure if him building his own database is the easiest way to go about it, but wondering if you can point me in the direction of off the shelf options that I could learn about.

We correlated the events to a CredentialProvider DLL that was installed by Duo. 1 second after the DLL was registered we started to see login failures. The failures actually occurred slowly with a Kerberos pre-auth failure for each account every 7 minutes between 10:30 and 10:51 where all accounts were locked at 3 wrong attempts. Although we are not 100% certain this caused the issue, we have been unable to fine any other IOCs on the network.

My advice to everyone - log everything. And if you don't have a SIEM get one. We use Graylog and its amazing.

Hi All, 

Last night we detected abnormal lockout activity across out network. Within seconds all accounts across our network were locked out by kadmin/changepw. All events originated by a domain controller that was rebooting. All events were 4771, Kerberos Pre-Authentication failed with a result code of 0x12. 

We gained access and immediately removed our internet connections. We have no idea what happened, and it is looking more and more like a bug in AD. We checked the following things.

* SIEM logs from the firewall and from our domain controllers, nothing by legit DNS traffic.
* No abnormal scheduled tasks on any workstations or servers.  
* Cylance Protect + Optics logs, no abnormal activity. No detected executables, no new scripts ran anywhere across the network. No hits on Optics. 
* Checked OWA + Netscaler logs, nothing abnormal. We have rate limiting and a WAF in front of both as well. Everything is 2FA w/ Duo. 
* Coordinated with out firewall vendor to see if they detected any abnormal network connections - no known malicious connections. 
* Checked AD for any modifications of the Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins and other sensitive groups, none. 
* Looked for abnormal password resets, none. 
* Checked for Keberos golden ticket. 
* No evidence of LSASS dumping 

We then unlocked all locked accounts and changed passwords of the domain admin accounts. We reconnected the internet and monitored for any more lockouts - Silence.

610,t3_gcdmyc,"Hey Sysadmin folks! I am so happy to see this group exists. I could really use some advice. I'm the IT manager for a company that builds large custom machinery for automotive companies. I've been disappointed with our legacy ERP &amp; timekeeping systems since I got this job. The company is fantastic. We build and engineer everything in America- we make some of the coolest machinery out there. But we are stuck in the past.

Our machines take 6-12 months to design, and the same amount of time to build. These machines are the size of large houses in many cases. We are typically working on 3-8 of these machines at any given time. Everything is custom built to our customer's production needs, but we do keep a large stock of commonly used components.

These machines that we build have hundreds of tasks/ subassemblies, and they take such a long time to build that we haven't been able to find anything that actually works well. 

Ideally, I could create a new project only *one time* in this new- dream ERP. (As opposed to having to create and track all of the tasks/ subassemblies in 3 different programs.) The 100 or so tasks (allocated across the dozen or so subassemblies) that make up a full machine could sync with:

· Full featured project management module. Integrated Gantt charts are a must. (Schedule is very important, visibility on who is doing what over the months is critical). 

· Project based accounting. (Labor and component costs flowing into tasks.) 

· Timekeeping (Everyone from engineers to welders to logistics personell clock into the same tasks but charge different types of work to them.) 

· Resource planning (Departments/ people are allocated to taskbars within the project management interface; their commitments could be visible and the resource vould go red if it was overcommitted during a certain timeframe). 

Of course, I’m assuming the ERP would have standard modules for all other business needs. 

Other very nice to haves would be: 

* Cloud based. Maybe open source? Some options are just too expensive.
* Integration with- or inclusion of- mobile clock in app. We have many remote workers when we install these machines at customer sites. 
* Integration with- or inclusion of- invoicing / service-center module. We do a decent amount of aftermarket work for our customer base. 

I have looked at Oracle/ Netsuite a lot. It is just too expensive. Microsoft Dynamics is fairly expensive too- and really falls short on the project management side of things. Odoo maybe looks good, and all of the opensource stuff is much more affordable/ appealing, but I don’t know anything about opensource and it doesn’t seem like any of it is well suited for manufacturers who make huge always-custom things; just manufacturers who crank out the same goods over and over. Job-shop focused ERPs also seem to fall short on accommodating the length and amount of tasks and subassemblies that we produce. Meetings with Shoptech E2 &amp; JobBoss haven’t been great.

1. If and when you encounter this issue again so many months down the line (let's be real, it's IT), you'll thank yourself because there's a good chance you might have forgotten how you fixed it.

My task today was to fire it up and check it out. The instructions I was able to get out of the previous developer was to just start the EC2 server instances, create a DNS cname record to the AWS load balancers in the project instance and it should come back up and be available. That is he said if no one had done anything to it in the year this thing has been in hibernation.   

Did that and of course nothing by 503 errors for my effort.

The servers are little guys 16GB of RAM 100GB hard drives and 4 processors.  

Now here is the kicker, the failed company paid nearly $200,000 for this project. I'm a windows sysadmin on a good day and this is my first exposure to AWS. It's really neat to gain exposure to this tech and I'll certainly learn more, but today I need somebody to look at this and tell me if there is anything here, and if so how to get it linked back together and started.

-Update Hyper-V services on VMs
-Boot App server and test before booting AD

Most things I found were either about ""transitioning from sysadmin to dev"" or ""becoming a sysadmin from scratch"" which contains a lot of ""noise"" for me (I know my way around a console).

It's entirely possible I missed something.
If that's the case please point me at it.

## My Background

I've been working as a full-stack dev for over 5 years now.
During this time I've:

- wrote new applications from scratch
- worked extensively with Docker
- setup and maintained CI pipelines (Jenkins, Travis, and CirlceCI)
- deployed into and worked with a k8s cluster
- used some Terraform to provision the occasional DB

As you might see I know the basics.
I'm comfortable working with a CLI interface.

This also means that I have a hard time finding resources with a low ""signal to noise"" ratio on learning the Linux sysadmin ropes.

## What I've considered

During my research I came across a bunch of suggestions:

- everything on the [bootcamp page of the wiki][bootcamp]
- setup a Linux box from scratch, break it and try to repair it, do it again
- work through [Linux From Scratch][linux-from-scratcH]
- get a [linuxacademy][linuxacademy] subscription

Now these are all valuable suggestions!
But with my current know-how, I have a hard time determining which of these is the best point to start.

## What I hope for from you

As a father of two small kids, I __do not__ have a lot of time on my hand.
This means I would rather like to avoid delving into the ""wrong"" thing, to not ""lose"" a lot of the little time I have.

What I hope for is some feedback on where I get the best ""return of investment"" from where I'm standing at right now.
That might be you pointing at the list above, saying ""do them in the order you listed"", or maybe it's something totally different.
One way or another, I can more confidently begin to invest the little time I have into learning.

Please point me at something and tell me ""with your current know-how you best do _this_""

## What I want to learn

While I might be comfortable working as a full-stack dev, I'm totally lost when it actually gets to setting up and maintaining the underlying machines and networks.

At the end of this I would like to feel know how to:

1. setup a bunch of Linux boxes from scratch, be they bare metal or VMs (knowing which distro to chose, what software to install etc.)
2. configure a proper and secure network between said boxes
3. monitor the boxes and troubleshoot issues
4. keep the boxes up-to-date and secure
5. automate most, if not all of this

I expect that - after I got a good grasp of points 1 to 4 - point 5 will be quite simple.
After all automating things is basically my current job description.

I do not need to learn all this on an enterprise level - although I think I'll be able to expand into this area once I check all the boxes.
For now I would like to be able to do this at home and from there move to doing the same in a cloud environment.

I expect a good test would be to setup a k8s cluster from scratch, which would most likely include all the relevant skills.

I'm prepared that getting there will take months.

### TL;DR

I'm a dev with 5 years of Docker, CI, and backend dev experience with little time (2 kids).
Which resources on learning the Linux sysadmin ropes have a low ""signal to noise"" ratio with my current background?

I have a reseller account with a very important product that my customers purchase from me. The way it works is that I have a ""master"" reseller account and they have individual customer accounts. That way a customer can login and see their account status, pay their bill, etc.

One of my customers just had one of their employees resign (let's call her Stephanie). Stephanie was the one that paid that bill every month. Stephanie's replacement contacted me today asking how to get access to the portal so they could take over Stephanie's duties.

No problem. Login to reseller portal, change the contact information for the customer including the email address, and click the ""customer forgot password"" button in the reseller portal which sends them a link to change their password.

Or so I thought.

Stephanie's replacement forwarded me the email they got asking if it was legit. Good job. Always appreciate that especially if you're new and a random email is asking for you to click a link and set a password.

657,t3_gbjh2v,"I'm a DBA at a huge fortune 100 company. I support dozens of applications from different teams across the company and my work is a mix of issue support and helping implement new code/fixes to the it. Until recently my time tracking was simple. Company meetings were one bucket, Dev support is another, Prod support another, and then PTO.  It had been this way for years.

However recently our new parent company is pushing a standard for time tracking that makes no sense to me. Their standard is that a minimum of 50% of our weekly time needs to be charged to ""projects"" and not the dev or prod support. They've point blank said that if our team is not meeting this standard within a few months, we can expect a reduction in workforce because through their eyes it means we have too many employees. Whatever, seems reasonable, except:

\- Exec management have not communicated this to any of the application teams we support and won't be doing that. Not the exec that handles the development and systems departments, or our systems department to the application departments. It is our individual job as DBAs to let each customer we work with know that they now need to allocate budgeting, have a project manager go in and give me the ability to charge time against the project, argue with the PM about hours it took every week, and help them understand what a project is compared to baseline support. There is a doc only within our department about this, but we are not the same department as the many different application teams across the company.

\- Most of my customers don't even have a PM, project time/hours/ids in our system, or even the ability to use our time tracking system to allocate these hours to me to charge against. This past week for example, I must have spent at least 4 hours in meetings, emails, etc with just a single internal support customer trying to figure out how they can set up a project for me to charge time against, and the only answer I've gotten from anyone is ""oh we can't do that"". And it's only my problem, so no one else is following up.

\- Most of the customers are also not used to doing any of this for support. It has already been a struggle getting any of them to use our ticketing system instead of email or IMs. So far I've received confusion and anger from people who are mad because ""they never used to have to do any of this before"" and ""it sounds like a lot of paperwork.""

\- Management is not enforcing that we stop work for any teams that don't or can't do project hours. The teams don't care that I'm not able to charge project time, just that I keep working for them. My manager basically is just shrugging it off or saying ""yeah it's really annoying I wish they gave us better guidelines."" Ok great, well...

\- Some weeks there is just going to be a ton of support issues, and they don't at least on paper want us to track more than 40 hours a week. I've had weeks where I've done a full work week just handling people's issues. It sounds like I'm supposed to make up projects that don't even exist.

\- They are very vague about what a project is. For example if we help a customer having time out issues in their database and can easily identify an index that would help them, that is production support. If it ends up needing a deeper dive into their code that takes hours to debug stored procs and test, that becomes a project. It is up to me to randomly decide when it has crossed into ""project"" territory and start asking for project hours. I can just see that going great, explaining to a customer that their issue is suddenly a project that costs their department money when they are used to just getting all of my time for free, or when I did the same thing but in less time (because it was less complex or I was just awesome that week) it was baseline but now this new thing is a project.

\- It is now going to be an extra few hours a week just trying to keep track of this project stuff between tracking my hours, arguing with PMs or applications who don't consider something a project or the hours I want to charge, etc, for what is not a project based role (for example we still have on-call rotation and the expectation that all support work is prioritized over project work in terms of when it is done). And I am already very busy and not able to work in my own internal DBA projects as much as I'd like.

Is this the norm in corporate internal IT or am I missing something? I just want a job where I can show up, do my work, fill out a basic timesheet and get paid for my work. Not one where I have to explain to dozens of apathetic or cranky developers and business people they have to do paperwork and set things up for me to charge time against. Or be worried that me or someone on my team will be let go because I couldn't do anything when one of my customers says ""we don't have project hours.""

This is a problem with computer object's AD security group changes not processing at the client.

I am working with preparing Windows 10 1909.  I have a number of GPOs configured that use security group filtering to apply/deny.  I am pretty sure that there is no problem with the security filter based on the fix I found later and I am sure the problem is not AD replication issues.

When I add/remove a computer to/from an AD group and reboot, the computer is not processing that group memebership change correctly.  I noticed this because GPOs assigned to the newly added group were not being applied.  I ran GPResult and could see in the computer section's  security group information, that the computer was holding on to the *old* group memerships - even after an hour had passed and the computer was rebooted several times.  I thought at first maybe there was an AD replication problem but opening ADUC pointing to different DC, they all had the correct intformation.

But still GPResult was displaying old group memberships from earlier in the day.

Now, that is not a good situation.  We add computers to groups all the time to configure them in certain ways.  I cant have a case where making an AD group change doesn't take place immediately at  reboot.  Something.  Basically the idea was to open a system command window and delete/expire all the system's Kerberos tokens.  That did correct the problem.  This is why I don't suspect a problem with AD replication or a problem with the GPO security filters.  As soon as I flushed the Kerberos tickets, the client recomputed its group memberships and GPResult showed the correct information.  

Is there a setting in Windows 10 now that tells computers not to cache AD group memberships over a reboot?  Is this a new something in Win 10 1909 ?  Is this some part of Windows 10 fast boot or something like that?",Computers not detecting AD group changes on reboot,r/sysadmin,0.72,3,10,{}

I know this question has been asked a ton, but most of the threads are &gt;7months old so thought I'd ask in case anything has changed.

Basically our situation is:

* We're a young company (&lt;10 employees) and plan to scale to \~20 in the next year or so.
* None of us have a background in IT, and we likely won't have someone with that back ground for at least 2 years.
* We're mostly BYOD, but we're going to start distributing Macbook Airs to employees who ask for one. It'll likely be 1 -3 computers over the next few months, and maybe 10 a year from now.
* To start, we're just going to use an MDM with company computers. Eventually we'll want to get all the BYOD devices (including phones) into our system as well, but that's likely well over a year from now now. 100% of company provided computers will be macs, but I imagine a few BYODs will be PCs (although it'll be a very small amount)
* I want to 80/20 security as much as possible. Employees access sensitive customer information via our CRM, but nothing is saved locally. My best guess for how we manage that is by:
   * Requiring devices to have a firmware + user login password that's complex
   * Encryption turned on
   * Maybe, something like Malware Bytes
   * Password manager and unique logins for everything (not related to MDM)
* Beyond that, I don't have the bandwidth to deal with requests from users — if someone wants to download Spotify they can and I don't care. A best case scenario is this is something I can set and forget.

Are there any strong recommendations for an MDM based on the above? Apple recommended Jamfnow and Mosyle, and I independently came across Fleetsmith — although Apple recommended against them.

Jamfnow is confusing and there's no demo, so I disregarded it, and Mosyle seems adequate. That said, Fleetsmith seemed great — it appears to just work and is intuitive (much like Apple products). Of everything, it appears that I could set and forget Fleetsmith the best, but I'm worried since (1) I don't see much about them on here and (2) Apple actually recommended against them.

I'm also worried Fleetsmith is a great choice for right now, but maybe will present a headache as we scale and need to change systems (but with no experience I don't know how much to value this worry).

       Wondering if anyone's ran into this issue before using DW. We have LDAP bind set up, specifically looking to a SG. Everything has worked fine, bind is successful and so are imports. The problem is I am working on a migration that has me moving users into a new OU. When they're moved to the new OU they can no longer successfully auth to DW using their domain credentials. If I move them back it works fine. Some info:

- Brand new accounts created in the new OU have the same issue, if moved to the old one they're fine
- the BIND is looking for a SG membership, this SG remains in the same OU it has always been and that is not the same as the original OU I am moving users from either so nothing changes with this SG
- Import is successful, always
- Removing from DW and reimporting making no difference
- Resetting the password for the user's domain account does not resolve it
- We have a cameraaccessonly OU that was created when we set this up, its for outside access. These users are fine too.
- The issue seems to be with the OU that was created after the camera system was set up
- bind is not searching any specific OU except the default users which is where the SG for membership sits

So for some reason users can only auth if their in the original OU, but for all intents and purposes it shouldnt matter. Nothing looks directly at that old OU, its looking for group memership and the group is not being moved. 

Anyone have any suggestions?",Digital Watchdog - LDAP Issue,r/sysadmin,0.6,1,6,{}

With this whole Coronavirus thing happening, we are looking to replace our teacher workstations and Chromebooks with a Windows laptop that they can carry back and forth. We have roughly a $1000 budget per teacher with the device and dock included.

We were looking at third party docks that had VGA or HDMI support on them, along with a 3.5mm jack to interface with our projectors and sound systems in each classroom.

We were looking for touchscreen laptops that could ideally function as a tablet as well at about $800. I wanted to look around before talking to any reps and getting their prices and the first generation Microsoft Surface keeps coming up in my searches.

Have any of you had experience with these devices? The ones I was looking at have 7th Gen i5s (or maybe i7s, I can't remember), 8 Gigs of RAM, and 256 Gig SSDs. Anyone else have any other suggestions that I could look into that could be purchased in bulk. I estimate we will need ~100-150 of these devices.

1. Client is having no Proxy settings prior to VPN connection 
2. Client connects to the VPN
3. Proxy is automatically set to script by the anyconnect client and the connection tab in the Internet explorer options is being disabled 
4. Client gets the Internet Explorer GPO Settings from the Domain Controller within the regular schedule of gpo processing which is every 90 min
5. Domain GPO overrides (clears)the ASA Proxy changes though VPN connection still remains
6. Client loses connection to targeted internal sources due to the required proxy settings for the vpn connection.

How can I avoid the ASA settings getting overwritten or block the policy changes to the clients.

My latest problem is that some of my users like to customise their quick access, task bar pinned items, excel/outlook options etc very heavily, but the settings they change don't apply to all the hosts.  
I haven't had any experience with UPD or UE-V (as I've only ever had one host to work with) but it sounds like they would work to fix that problem.  

To complicate things, we have folder redirection turned on for my documents, downloads, desktop to a file server but some users have appdata redirected, and some don't.  

I'm hoping for the users that DON'T have appdata redirection turned on, I can use UPD or UE-V so they can change settings and their appdata is saved to the central location and, for example, each host would have the same quick access stuff pinned. It wouldn't effect their normal workstation, all appdata changes would be contained in the RDS environment, and the folder redirection for Downloads/Desktop to the file server would work as normal.  

My concern is that for the people who DO have appdata redirected is that the changes they make to Windows and appdata on the RDS environment will mess around with their normal workstations, and UPD or UE-V wouldn't really stop that from happening.  

So I guess my question is, can I stop appdata redirection from applying to the new RDS environment, so it just uses an appdata folder than is on the UPD or UE-V and keeps settings away from their workstation.

*Edit: Been doing some testing. Registry edit doesn't work on 1909. There is a better way, use secpol.msc*

In the absence of a VPN connection, when using some sort of remote assistance desktop sharing to administer the PC of WFH user you may encounter the problem of not being able to see a UAC for admin tasks.

This is because UAC normally appears on a separate secure desktop. You can force the UAC on to the user's desktop where you can see it by using secpol.msc to set 
Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation to Disabled.

~~following registry value:~~

~~HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System REG-DWORD EnableUIADesktopToggle = 1~~

~~But you cannot use Regedit to set the value even from the elevated command prompt because, you guessed it, UAC.~~


But you cannot use secpol.msc to set the value even from the elevated command prompt because, you guessed it, UAC. 

Now you don't want to give you user *your* admin credentials to enter into UAC, so here is a workaround:

Start elevated command prompt with RunAS

    c:\&gt;runas /user:example\user.name cmd.exe

In the elevated command prompt open local user manager

    c:\&gt;lusrmgr.msc. 

In local user manager create a throwaway temp user with a simple password and add to administrators group. Leave local user manager open.

Start Secpol

    c:\&gt;secpol.msc 

Get user to use the newly made temp user credentials in UAC for Secpol.

Set Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation to Disabled.

~~Start regedit~~

~~c:\&gt;regedit.msc~~ 

~~Get user to use the newly made temp user credentials in UAC for regedit.~~

~~Edit the EnableUIADesktopToggle value as above.~~

When done go back to local user manager and delete the throwaway admin account.

You will now have a UAC that you can see over your remote assistance tool.

Edit to add:

Some people are saying this or that tool avoids the problem. That is all well and good if the tool is/was available and that necessary work was was done ahead of time.

We've been using Datto/Backupify to backup Office 365, but I'm really unhappy with it: its interface is clunky at best, no API, reports are next to worthless, etc.

So I'm trying to find other alternatives -- I've seen others mentioned Acronis, Barracuda and Veeam, among different options. Ideally, we would like to keep a cloud-to-cloud backup solution, so that we don't have to deploy anything on-prem. It does seem that Veeam might be cheaper per user (18/user/year, compared to 27/user/year using Backupify), but that doesn't take into account storage/servers/etc.

So, price wise, what would you recommend to replace Backupify? Another alternative would be deploying Veeam in AWS. We've been using Veeam for vSphere and I'm quite happy with it.",Looking for Datto/Backupify Alternative,r/sysadmin,0.78,7,15,{}

My company uses a Cisco ASA with firepower with AnyConnect for VPN clients. The ASA appliance is configured in a HA pair and curently is handling DHCP for VPN connections. We are having issues where DNS for VPN connected clients is not updating consistenently and it breaks a couple applications we use. I think the best course of action is to switch to using DHCP relay to our DHCP server that handles the 10 or so other VLANs on our network. The alternative is configuring DDNS, but I'm not too familiar with that process (I know where to configure it, but don't know the appropriate settings to use).

Anyways, is there any concerns using DHCP relay vs the ASA IP pool either for security, reliability, or any other concenrs?

We have an RDS running win2012 r2 and have recently run into an issue where the system disk(c drive) is instantly filling and crashing the server.

This has happened twice now in the past day and normally the C drive will be sitting at around 10-12%(700gb total size) and looking at our zabbix graphs the C drive will randomly tank from 70gb all the way to 0 in 2 minutes or less. I cant access the console through ESXI to check anything as the machine is unresponsive. The only fix seems to be to reboot the server and the space is back to what it was before it crashed.

I'm trying to get, in any form, the offline files cache limit (maximum amount of space offline files can use on a Windows computer) programmatically, when the limit is not assigned by Group Policy.

The easiest way that the data can be accessed is by going to Control Panel &gt; Sync Center &gt; Manage Offline Files &gt; Disk Usage. The information I'm looking for is the space available, in use, and/or limit, for ""All Offline Files."" If I can get two of these values I can calculate the third. However, the information here is only provided visually, and I can't figure out where it's sourced from.

From what I've found, there's a registry entry when the limit is assigned by group policy, but we don't set the limit through  group policy. Therefore, the value is generally within the \~25% of total disk space range unless we've changed it in the past on that device. However, that \~25% seems to have some pretty large fluctuation.

* Thunderbolt from Macbook Pro to Dell Thunderbolt Dock
* 2x DisplayPort 1.4 from Dell Thunderbolt Dock to KVM Switch
* 1x DisplayPort 1.4 from KVM Switch to 1440p 144hz Monitor
* 1x DisplayPort 1.4 MST Hub from KVM Switch**
* 2x DisplayPort 1.4 from MST Hub to 1440p 60hz Monitors**
* Keyboard, Mouse, and Headphones from KVM Switch*

*Alternatively, would I be able to run these through the USB passthrough on the monitors? Not entirely sure if that would work, but if it does, this requirement is moot.

I know incorporating so many different pieces of hardware in one setup like this can cause massive headaches with setup and sometimes lead to compatibility issues, but I'm not entirely sure what my alternative is. From what I found online, my options were either a dual display DP switch, a quad display DP switch that supports up to four systems, or a triple display DP to HDMI switch. Everything I've read has indicated that using an MST to split one of the signals from the KVM switch shouldn't cause any issues.

I found two solid options while looking around on reddit and other sites ([ATEN CS1942DP](https://www.aten.com/us/en/products/kvm/desktop-kvm-switches/cs1942dp/) and [StarTech SV231DPDDUA2](https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/2-port-dual-dp-kvm-switch~SV231DPDDUA2)), but reading reviews online, they both seem to have issues with either audio passthrough or transmitting the full bandwidth required for 1440p 144hz. These are both dealbreakers for me, unfortunately. I was also pointed towards the [Level1 DP 1.4 Dual Monitor KVM Switch](https://store.level1techs.com/products/kvm-switch-2-port-dual-monitor-8k-model). This one looks the most promising, but I just want to make sure there are no other options out there that have integrated EDID feeding (the Level1 does not). I know KVM switches are typically unreliable and difficult to set up properly, but I'm hoping someone here might be using one that they've found to work well.

I've ordered a new 600GB SAS drive from Dell but the wait time is between 30 - 60 days! In the meantime, I have purchased an identical 'refurbished' 600GB SAS from a seller on eBay. Can anyone explain the process to replace the predicted fail drive with the refurbished SAS drive? Is it a matter of pull the old drive out, plug the new drive in while the server is being used?

Any advice would be great! I have backups of the VMs on the server if something were to go terribly wrong.

Thanks!

I've referenced our existing clients with roaming profiles and folder redirections, and have found that most of them are configured according to  [https://www.itpromentor.com/profile-permission/](https://www.itpromentor.com/profile-permission/) .  So I want to overwrite all the permissions correctly, and can do so scripted after hours if necessary, but don't want to break anything going forward.

The domain controller ""DC1"" is Windows Server 2016 Standard, the profile path for all users is ""\\\\FS1\\Homes\\%username%\\profile"", and the home folder path is ""U:\\"" = ""\\\\FS1\\Homes\\%username%\\personal"".

The file server ""FS1"" is Windows Server 2016 Standard, and the physical file structure is:

E:\\Homes\\%username%

Where AppData, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Favorites, Start Menu all reside.  Plus ""personal"", and ""profile.V2"" and ""profile.V6"" reside also.  The ""profile.V2"" folder is the old Windows 7 data for which no more workstations exist, and ""profile.V6"" is the Windows 10 data.  The ""personal"" folder is their U:\\ drive.

I'm not opposed to moving the ""personal"" folder to a proper structure if need be, but right now the focus is fixing the folder permissions so that when a new user is created by copying from an existing user, we don't see a message about needing to create the user folders manually and then having to adjust permissions manually.

I'm ready to attack this with icacls but need to know ahead of time if any of you have encountered a similar situation and how you resolved it.

813,t3_gb1rqh,"Hey all,

I'm looking into ways of automating Windows Server patching, and not just the actual patch installation and rebooting. I would like to find a good orchestration/automation tool that would allow us to set up specific rules about which hosts to patch first, and also allow us to set up a series of checks after patching is done. 

For instance, our Lync pool would need to only be patched one server at a time, and between patching and rebooting of each server, a check would need to verify that the fabric health is OK. Once all servers are done patching a final check on the fabric health would be needed as well.

We have hundreds of servers and a relatively small outage window, so automating as much as possible makes sense to me. We use SCCM, I am working on implementing ADRs and phased deployments. However from what I've seen so far, SCCM does not have the ability to perform predefined health checks as part of the update process.

Recently, things have been tense with this client because they're refusing to pay me the rate they had agreed to. I don't want to cause any further issues with them while I sort out the payment issue, so I'm planning on downloading the software.

HOWEVER, I find it a complete invasion of my privacy that they want to log my keystrokes and take screenshots while I'm tracking time. **Is there a way to block the desktop Hubstaff app from doing this? Or possibly remove those permissions? I'm using a 2013 MacBook Pro running macOS Catalina.** 

They've specifically requested that I use the desktop app because the browser and iOS versions don't take screenshots. My top concern at the moment is that I don't want them to be able see rough drafts of the emails I'm sending them because, like I said, things are a little tense.

I also believe employee monitoring software is unethical. When I'm working on projects (I'm a graphic designer &amp; animator), I spend time away from my computer just thinking, or sometimes sketching out ideas, but still using brain power dedicated toward my project. Something like Hubstaff would flag this as an inactive period. This is just one reason, among many, that I would prefer to not use the software. However, if I bring these issues up with my client I'm worried that they'll drop my services and not pay me the money that they currently owe me.

EDIT:
For anyone else who’s facing this problem: it looks like there’s no real technical solution. A VM might work if you know how to set one up correctly, but from my understanding there’s a lot of potential for that to go wrong. 

After some extra research, the best solution I could find was to inform my client that by using employee monitoring software I would be putting my other clients’ information at risk. If the software took a screenshot of another client’s internal files or company information I could potentially breach my NDA. I then informed them that I’d be willing to use the software if they sent me a separate work computer - which I really doubt they’ll want to go through with (thanks for the suggestion). 

This isn’t a perfect solution either but at least it gives me an arguably better reason why I’m refusing to use the software. 

Also, for those of you wondering why I’m not pushing back more: this is my biggest client - the work I do for them brings in over half my monthly income depending on the month. We’re also in the middle of a pandemic right now and everyone’s quarantined (at least in my state). No one else is hiring.

I was looking into VMWare and other options but I have never worked with VMWare before and was hoping someone could shed some light on whether that would be a viable option to keep my costs down. Hardware is looking like its going to cost ~5K so I have roughly 1-3K to work with to get four virtual machines spooled up.

832,t3_gaz622,"Hello! I am a beginner sysadmin with limited (mostly Linux and FreeBSD) experience. I have been working with a client that has a small office, \~10 people with an upcoming expansion to a total maximum of 20.

&amp;#x200B;

We have redone and reconfigured their network and have put a pfSense router, a FreeNAS server and an XCP-NG hypervisor in place.

&amp;#x200B;

The client is really keen on not losing data and not having downtime. He is willing to spend a bit more for the sake of everything being safe and working correctly and is quite tech-savvy so he is really nice to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

His employees are using regular Windows 10 workstations, mainly for: 

1. the Office Suite 
2. A proprietary business CRM-like software that is hosted on a Server 2016 machine (that will be converted to a VM soon) and has a Windows 10 client program 
3. Web browsers

&amp;#x200B;

Since the employees are not really keen on backing up their stuff to the FreeNAS server or the cloud (Dropbox), we have been looking for a solution to make sure no data is lost and no downtime occurs due to workstation hardware failures (which would most commonly be a drive failure).

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been thinking of repurposing the current and future workstations as thin clients, possibly with the implementation of an AD DC and automatic mapping of all the usual Windows directories to FreeNAS SMB shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, going with a server-side based solution would allow us to use used thin clients, raspberry pis or something else that is low cost and low power for the upcoming office expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to keep to FOSS as much as possible, mainly due to cost.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have been thinking about:

Boot the clients to openthinclient or thinstation from the network and use RDP or Spice, depending on what we will go for.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario A:

Build a sort-of VDI solution, based on either XCP-NG or Proxmox with VM storage on FreeNAS. Going with KVM could open the path to using Ravada VDI or something similar for a FOS VDI broker, use spice, or implement hardware GPU acceleration with the help of an AMD S7150X2 since it supports SR-IOV on Linux. We only really need a base image and VM clones and we would probably tie it to a Windows or Samba AD DC or other solutions such as Zentyal. We would probably need to buy a dual or quad Sandy or Ivy Bridge used CPU server.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario B:

Deploy Windows RDS from a Windows 2019 server, either physical or virtual. Problem is, I have no idea how Windows RDS works, if I can use Linux clients for it, what kind of limitations it has and what kind of hardware + licensing I would need.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Does Spice suck?
2. Does RDP suck?
3. Would you go through the hassle of implementing HW graphics acceleration and for what reason? (VDI scenario)
4. I absolutely need low-level USB redirection. AFAIK that means I need to either use spice or RemoteFX. Does RemoteFX even work with hypervisors other than Hyper-V and clients other than Windows?
5. Would you go for A or B and why? Is it too much hassle?
6. What kind of problems can you identify in my way of thinking? Am I missing something or have misunderstood something?

We are using a self-signed cert, not a public trusted SSL cert. That being said, since setting up the CA, we're still getting the 'Your connection is not private' warning when visiting websites that reside within our domain/intra-net. Is there a fix for this without purchasing a Trusted SSL Cert from a provider? What I have verified:

1.) The CA Cert is being pushed to the devices in question

2.) Our domain CA is in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities section for the assets in question

3.) The assets in question have personal certs issued (not expired) from the CA

I feel as though there might have been some kind of setting/configuration I may have missed when creating the initial cert to begin with as my understanding is that any domain asset should still be trusted by virtue of the domain CA being a trusted root ca. Thank you in advance for your insight as I've already done extensive googling and banging of my head against the wall on this issue so far. I do appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Following u/OhioIT's advice, I was able to get the issue resolved. See below:

I was getting a ' NET::ERR\_CERT\_COMMON\_NAME\_INVALID' error due to the incorrect configuration of the cert applied to the web server. This was because the cert being used didn't have the appropriate 'Subject Alternative Name' (SAN) entries. So how did I fix it?

1. On the CA server, I cloned the Web Server Template and adjusted the compatibility to the oldest server/workstations in our environment (2012/Windows 8.1) and on the Cryptography tab, I selected 'Requests can use any provider available on the subject's computer'. In the security tab, I added the two servers that would be using the cert with read/write/enroll permissions enabled and saved it.
2. Also on the CA server, I issued that template within certsrv
3. On the IIS servers, I opened MMC and under the Personal/Certificates, I requested a new certificate. I selected the new web server cert.
4. **(IMPORTANT)** For the uninitiated, make sure you check the following:
   1. 'Subject Name:Type' was set to 'Common Name' and I entered '[server.contoso.com](https://server.contoso.com)' and added it.
   2. 'Alternative name: Type:' was set to DNS and I entered just the dns name without the domain attached (example: server, not [server.contoso.com](https://server.contoso.com)) and added it.
   3. 'Alternative name: Type:' was then set to IP which auto filled the server's IP address and added it
   4. 'Alternative name: Type:' was finally set to URL and I added the URL's that would be used by the websites and added. 
   5. on the General tab, I added the friendly name and description for ease of finding the cert when applying it in IIS.
   6. Then I finished enrolling the cert and it was then available for IIS to use.
5. In IIS (Internet Information Services Manager) I selected the Default Web Site under the ServerName/Sites/ folder and selected Bindings -&gt; 443 -&gt; and selected the appropriate server which was easy using the descriptors i set in the steps above. 
6. Then I restarted the website and blammo: Cert works!

Up until a couple of days ago, things were printing fine, now all of a sudden we are unable to print anything. Documents will briefly spool and then disappear from the queue. If a printer is set to keep printed documents in the queue they will show as printed instantly after they finish spooling no matter how many pages are supposedly printed (I've tried upwards of 1600 pages).

Here's the troubleshooting I've tried so far:

* Ensured Print Server has the latest Windows Update
* Uninstalled the most recent non-security updates since problems started (and shortly before)
* Restarted Server
* Restarted Print Spooler service, both using the restart option and simply stopping and starting it
* Ensured printers print on their own; both configuration pages and USB direct connect
* Tried printing from Multiple computers, including the print server itself
* Shut down print spooler and cleared everything out of System32\\spool\\PRINTERS
* For one of our multi-purpose printers I:
   * Created a new printer and port to it's IP address
   * Tried literally ever latest Windows 10 Driver available on the manufacturer's site
   * Tried every Print Processor
   * Unchecked ""Render print jobs on client computers""
   * Unchecked ""SNMP Status Enabled"" in the port configuration
   * Set it to print only after all pages are spooled
   * Unchecked ""Print spooled documents first""
   * Checked ""Hold mismatched documents""
   * Set a new IP Address

The only major change since this problem arose was a change to the permissions, but as far as I can tell the permissions are set up correctly and this doesn't sound like a permissions issue because there's no permissions errors and documents are spooling correctly.

Any new suggestions are welcome because I've run out of ideas and at this point we are considering just rebuilding the thing on physical hardware to see if Hyper-V is causing the issue.  


EDIT:

Figured out the problem. Turns out it was a permissions issue. We had removed the Everyone group from the Print Server Properties ACL while setting up our new groups in there. The problem is that the Service group isn't included in the ACL by default meaning that while everyone had permission to print, and were able to spool documents correctly, the print spooler service itself didn't have permission to print. 

After giving the Service group permission to print we were good to go.

I'm the ICT lead in a small company employee wise. We're big enough to have about 7 directors though. These directors are based  in the UK, so we have a time difference (we're -4:00). These directors also own their own devices, and only some of them have and use our corp email because they have their own thing going. Think the rich, globe trotting type.

Now it has always been a challenge with these guys n gals. They don't pay much mind to the tech side of things, yet still expects to have communication benefits. And of course, the department's still fully responsible for them being able to communicate well. To add to this, some use Apples. 

So the scenario is this:  As some of you would know, MS offered 6 months O365 E1 for free to help with comms during the current pandemic. We took this offer to be able to use Teams and is in the middle of deployment. 

I took the responsibility of emailing each user with guidance and links, as well as end user training videos and I copy one of the support staff to further help with Anydesk and the installation. Brent, one of the support team's especially bothered by the extra responsibility we have over these directors, and maybe it's my mistake for letting him in on the current deployment.

Brent's wife started spiking his coffee with Jack Daniels for fun yesterday morning, until he went full Jack n Coke. by 10am, Brent's proper. I did not know this at the time.

Adrian, one of the directors, responds to our initial emails, saying he logged in, changed his password, installed Teams on his Mac, and now it's stuck on initializing. He asked what could be the problem and what could he do to progress.

Brent responded to the email with ""F*ck knows..""

My wife was home yesterday and we share a big desk. She said she saw me turn white.

I immediately called Brent and while asking him what the hell, the managing director calls me to ask what the hell. Adrian forwarded the email to him.

The managing director was furious. He said he was calling HR after, and prepare to start the protocol to change admin passwords, Brent was out.

I called Adrian after, apologizing profusely for the response he got, and telling him I'm putting someone else from support on it for him. His response was ""What was he drinking?"". 

This dude's so lucky. Adrian said that he knows that IT would be under pressure with the work from home shift, and he understands Brent. Said next time he's in the country for a personal board meeting he'll take him out for some Jack. The MD still got him a week's suspension without pay, and Brent doesn't care because he's saving on the commute anyway.

Inherited a ""project"" and am not a storage guy, but since I am the only person on the team that is somewhat proficient with \*nix I got stuck with it.

Setup (from what I can tell):

R720 with (2) LSI PCI-e SAS cards

    03:00.0 RAID bus controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic MegaRAID SAS 2208 [Thunderbolt] (rev 05)
    06:00.0 Serial Attached SCSI controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS2008 PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS-2 [Falcon] (rev 03)

Powervault MD3220:

SAS cable connected from array RAID controller 0 to R720 HBA card 1 and controller 1 to HBA card 2. (I don't know if this cabling is right but when I powered on the MD3220 the light finally went blue instead of flashing orange)

Nothing else plugged into MD3220, *management port is not being used*.  No other host will have access to the storage array.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've done so far:

Re-imaged the OS, using the PERC raid and local drives to the R720 for storage.   Installed Dell MCCS and ran it, during auto discovery it says *no arrays were found*.

Q1) Is the management port (192.168.128.101) **absolutely** required for direct attached? My understanding was that you could have it use In-band management...

Q2) Do I have to assign IP addresses to the SAS ports?  And if yes, how, what iface are they?

I can see the MD32xx in the /proc/scsi/scsi so I'm not sure what else I need to do for the MCCS to see the array so I can create and format partitions that the OS can see and use.

I'm used to updating SSL certs on a single domain basis. Exchange, cool. IIS, cool. I've done this in the past for wildcards. I'm just hitting a wall now with a Cisco ASA, which, of course, I've never done before.

I'm in ASDM now and trying to remember how I used OpenSSL to split private key, public key, and certificate. The networking engineer I'm working with is confessing the same: not really understanding how certificates work. I understand you need a CA (public), a private key, and the certificate. I DON'T understand the difference between the p7b (bundle file), DER, PKCS7/12, etc.

I currently don't have access to the original CSR. I have a wildcard p7b. I don't know how to extract the information that this Cisco ASA needs. I'm using ADSM to install the identity certificate. I installed the root and intermediary certificates.

I've been using OpenSSL and Google to try to grab whatever files... I don't even know if that's what ADSM is asking for. I grabbed a private key file and a certificate file, but neither work. Apparently, whatever I grabbed does not work for ADSM.

911,t3_gadeo8,"Update below.

I'm trying to get rid of some phantom proxy server settings on multiple Win10 computers. We do have a proxy server, but are trying to decommission it. However, multiple computers keep connecting to it and I can not find what is pointing them there.

There doesn't seem to be a proxy set, but a packet capture clearly shows traffic being sent to our old proxy server by Outlook and IE (and Chrome). If I disable proxy auto detect, things work normally, but if I re-enable it, traffic again goes to the proxy.

What I've tried:

1. Check if wpad and wpad.&lt;domain&gt; are resolvable. They are not.
2. Check both DHCP servers to see if they are handing out proxy autoconfig urls. They are not.

At this point, there should be no proxy auto-config, but it is still occurring. So I dug deeper:

1. Win 10 -&gt; Settings -&gt; search for Proxy -&gt; Proxy  Settings. The only thing on is automatically detect.
2. Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options -&gt;  Connections -&gt; Lan Settings. The only thing on is automatically detect.
3. Went through every GPO looking for a proxy being set. Nothing.
4. Searched the computer's registry for the port the computer is using to talk to the proxy. Nothing with the proxy server's name or address.
5. Looked at the start up scripts. I did find one that sets HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Connections\\DefaultConnectionSettings which could contain proxy server settings hex encoded. However, commenting that out in the script, removing the setting from the computer and rebooting did nothing. It also was almost all 00, so it is unlikely that was doing it.
6. Checked C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\Custom\\ and C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Internet Explorer\\Custom\\ for possible custom file (which can be created from the IEAK). Nothing.
7. Checked \`netsh winhttp show proxy\`. No proxy set.
8. Did a complete reset of IE, hoping it was a case of a correct setting that was actually wrong. No change.
9. Attempted to disable the proxy via powershell reg edit: \`set-itemproperty 'HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings' -name ProxyEnable -value 0\`. No change.

Any ideas?

**Update:** Searching through the computer's registry, I came across a key WpadDetectedURL with an old auto proxy config file. I say old because I deleted it myself. But lacking any other ideas, I tried the url in Edge. It let me download the file!

So I went back and checked the server it was originally hosted on. Yes, it is gone. In fact, the webserver itself is turned off. A tcp-ping confirmed that. Maybe, since the proxy is still on, the proxy was serving up a cached copy of it? So I reset the proxy's cache and I cleared Edge's cache. But I could still download the file.

So I cleared Edge's cache again and ran tshark. Then I proceeded to successfully download the file again. Looking at the packet capture, I can NOT find any get request for it nor that file name in any of the packets (download is http, not https). Wireshark's export http objects doesn't show it either. So I was able to download a file without downloading it??? WTF!?!? (Yes, I captured on the correct interface. There were other objects I captured from other tabs in Edge mandated by corporate policy.)

As a sanity check, I attempted to repeat the download \[via Edge\] on a computer that is not having the problem. The download failed as it should have.

**Update 2:** Resolved (not solved). I deleted the key WpadDetectedURL, and changed the keys WpadDecision to 0 and WpadDecisionReason to 1 under the same parent. Rebooted and machine is working fine. I did find there was more than one WpadDetectedURL, so you may have to do this more than once. The keys were under HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Wpad\\&lt;some guid&gt;\\

I never did figure out where that file was being ""downloaded"" from.

Our needs will be spread over 3 products: Office 365 E1, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, and O365 E3.

It seems like the only meaningful limitations of M365 BP compared to O365 E3 are a 300 license max, reduced mailbox and onedrive storage, as well as limited DLP, eDiscovery, and in-place hold features. Otherwise, M365 BP has ATP P1, full Azure P1 is rolling out, and because we're a nonprofit, comes in at half the cost of O365 E3 with those add-ons.

Right now our AD is all on-prem. We'll use Azure AD Connect to sync the two directories, and once 365 is off the ground, introduce Duo to work with Azure for MFA &amp; SSO.

Also the min specs for the Linux server to run DAG seem way to high for most SMBs needs (10-100 users). 2 cores, 4GB memory + 20GB of storage. I would have thought that half that would be more than adequate in most scenarios.  Seems a bit wasteful spinning these up left right and centre just for a bit of middleman authentication. If you want to run 2 for high availability, costs go up again.

946,t3_g9wtc1,"A month ago I was fired to save money for my ex-company.   My background is in Windows systems, VMWare, and network administration.  But I'm also a jack-of-all-trades type admin who is comfortable with anything IT related from wiring to security, cell phones, VoIP, Exchange, SQL, desktop and hardware support, plus I'm well versed on Linux and OSX.  I've been doing all of this for about 30 years.  Most of my jobs had lasted 5-8 years so I'm not a job jumper.  Last time I was unemployed was 12 years ago and that was for 3 weeks.  But I'm 50 now.

I inherently don't like the idea of being on unemployment but I'm getting regular unemployment plus the additional Covid-19 funds which are to last until the end of July, and then just regular unemployment until the end of December.  So my family and I are OK money wise plus savings we could ride this out a while.

What I've been doing every day is watching learning videos on every topic for about 6 hours and not just putting a video on and vegging out but actively taking notes, researching concepts, etc.  Sites like LinkedIn Learning, YouTube, and some other free or lower cost sites.   Everything from Linux to Server 2019 to Python to networking to photography to beer making.  Honestly I'm liking it.  I never got a chance to keep up with technology and the ex-job was not particularly keen on us carving out time for learning so I learned on my own when I had time, which wasn't a lot.  I have ESXi and VirtualBox on two machines and have been setting up virtual labs, OS's and just enjoying my time learning.

I figured I would take a 4-6 months and use that time to learn but how do I express this to potential employers in the future?  I've seen, and have had headhunters pass me jobs that I was well qualified for that I just ignored.  I'm just not ready to go back yet.  I guess I just say nothing was what I was looking for?

I suppose I'm just curious how others would handle this situation?   Are there any learning sites you could recommend?  Should I be going for a certification?  We have savings, but I don't know if spending on more expensive training would benefit me at my age?

Access to their work systems has been realized through RDP but the telephone solution we've create (more or less on the fly) is still lacking.

For the moment we forward their work extensions to their (personal) mobile phones via Single Number Reach.

At their office they use a Cisco Callmanager and (mostly) Cisco 7821 phone with a headset attached to the phone.

Before the Covid-19 crisis they have been testing with a softphone configuration (via Cisco Jabber) which worked well enough at their office, but due to the big difference in quality available PCs and laptops which are mostly personal and not company issued they don't see softphones being a good solution.

This leaves a hardware solution in which they could plug their deskphones into. Such a solution would have to overcome a few key issues:

* great variety in internet connections
* mostly no fixed IP addresses
* most users don't have any cabling but just work via WiFi from their kitchen table
* some kind of VPN is needed, exposing a Cisco Callmanager to the internet is akin to suicide

So I have come to the conclusion that I need a magic box that can do/must have:

* OpenVPN client
* Function as WiFi client/bridge
* PoE to power the phone (not a show-stopper if not)

And I'd need approx. 40 of them, so availability is also an issue. Oh, and of course it needs to be 'budget friendly' (whatever that means).

I have a handful of remote computers in my network, that when I try to ping, I get destination unreachable.

I do know that it has a good IP, these tools just think it has a different IP for some reason. I also can't RDP the system through hostname or IP either, nor can I get powershell to do anything to them remotely (enter-pssession, any command with ""-computername"" parameter, etc all fail to connect, but I can remote powershell normally to systems that don't have this issue).

If I physically go to the remote computer, and do an ipconfig on it, I see it's REAL IP, and there are no connectivity issues. I can also remote back to a server successfully, ping a server, browse the web, etc. The users of these problem computers haven't noticed anything and aren't complaining, but this has probably been an issue for quite some time.

I need to get this fixed because although the users are able to do everything they need to do, this DNS issue seems to be what's causing these systems to also not be getting their security updates correctly and it's showing on our vulnerability scans.

I feel like it's gotta be something DNS related, but because (seemingly) the hostname resolves to the incorrect IP, I can't do ipconfig /flushdns or /release &amp; /renew, etc. without physically going to each one of these systems and doing it manually.
