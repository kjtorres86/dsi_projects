,changemyview,"I will start by saying that I am not religious, and that this is a religious topic (didn't want to put the ""fired up"" religious wording in the title, in an effort to keep this discussion civil).

I am specifically referring to the fact that Jewish people are not allowed to do anything that can be considered ""work"" outside their home on a Saturday. This includes carrying objects. In order to get around this, in Manhattan, there is a wire strung around a whole bunch of light poles up off the ground enclosing a large portion of the island, such that people can say ""I am within the wire, so I am *teeeechnically* indoors, so I can carry stuff.""

I don't understand the point in imposing upon yourself this rule (and I do think it's imposed upon yourself rather than imposed upon you by your religion - you can choose not to be Jewish, or choose to ignore parts of the religion you don't agree with. Nobody is holding you at gunpoint), if you're going to break it. I can understand someone wanting to have the rule if that's what they want. I can also understand someone wanting to not have the rule. But I don't understand what the benefit is in saying ""I am going to follow the rule, but when I don't want to follow the rule, I'm going to stretch definitions such that I am now allowed to break the rule without actually breaking it"". Again, I'm not religious, but I don't think you're supposed to circumvent God like this by finding your own way to make yourself compliant. Presumably God has the ability to interpret things and would be able to say ""Oh, come on now, that doesn't count"".

I'm getting a bit into the weeds, but my point is that I don't see the purpose in trying to circumvent your own rule. It seems silly. CMV.

,changemyview,"Do I think fat people should be shamed for the extra weight they carry? No. Do I think they should be praised for carrying it proudly? No

By promoting body positivity we're telling people essentially that any body type is okay. And while I'm not saying we should all be athletic gods and goddesses, no one should be happy with or encouraged to be proud of their overweight.

Obese people die sooner and have worse health complications. By telling young, impressionable people that their bodies are perfect just the way they are, we are promoting children to develop bad eating and exercise habits because we lie and tell them that their body is beautiful.

Body neutrality is better because it should be okay to hate parts of your body and want to change them. As I said, fat people shouldn't be shamed because of their lack of health. But honestly, obesity is gross, unhealthy, and leads to things like a higher chance of heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cancer, etc. 

Body positivity doesn't promote a healthy person as a whole. While it may \*superficially \*help their mental health it doesn't benefit their physical health which is equally important.

Edit: sorry I came here to try and learn from a good argument. So many people are downvoting my comments. I honestly don't care do as you want. But I'm unsure if that's the best option when an opinion doesn't work with yours

Edit 2: if you're going to put down well people with [very specific condition] can't help but be fat that still isn't an argument for body positivity imo but you'll comment anyways so what do I care

Edit 3: this is becoming a lot for now. It's almost 3 a.m. where I'm at I'll check back in on this in the morning. Lots of people getting really fired up. I cane here for a good argument to help change my view not to be internet yelled at lol. But again, what the hell do I care what y'all do

Edit 4: Wow okay before you comment let me just put up some common misconceptions. I am not saying that we should tell fat people that they are gross straight up to their face. I'm saying as a society we shouldn't promote unhealthy body types. If you're here to say something off topic I'm really not interested in responding. By the kill themselves content in the title in referring to the onslaught of health conditions. I do not care about the time you bribe your leg and gained 20 pounds for 6 months. All I think is that as a society we should printer healthy lifestyle choices

Edit 5: I am open to changing my view and two arguments have struck some change in me. But I'm not fully convinced. I've mentioned in multiple comments that I understand my view is viewed as toxic by many but I dunt have anything compelling to change it

Edit 6: at this point in time people are commenting just to comment and it's getting really off topic. I'm not sure what my sexuality has to do with anything.

First off. I'll say that it's okay to not like a comic, or to not like it's story or characters or message/moral. That's an opinion and it's okay to have one. Simply saying politics should stay out of comics is not valid. I'm not saying every comic needs or even has a political message, some are just dumb fun.

However, throughout the publication history of comics there have been many cases in which the writer/creator injects topical and political elements into the stories. From the very creation of the superhero genre, politics has been part of the story. Superman, the first superhero, is an illegal alien created by two Jewish guys in the 1930s.

People only complain because they don't like the message. The same people complaining that Iceman is gay now are totally fine with the X-men as a whole. The X-men were an obvious allegory for race relations when they were created and now are compared with LGBT rights.

Essentially; politics are, always have been, and should continue to be a part or comics. Those who complain about it only disagree with the specific message.

,changemyview,"This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele's weight loss *rolls eyes*
It's been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it's because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. 

But let's be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I'll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It's not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? 

Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let's face it. Losing weight sucks and it's really really hard. It's so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that's why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I've seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.

Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I'm trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It's not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. 

And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn't have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as.

Ok so I am very much hoping that someone on here can really change my view because I do feel awful saying this, but it’s been something on my mind. So here’s where I’m at:

I go to one of the top universities in the US, and our undergraduate program is heavily dominated by pre-med folk. Because it’s an elite university, there are a good chunk of students from wealthy families here. While my school was not specifically indicted by the whole college admissions scandal a year ago, I can’t help but see some of the privileges wealth can buy in getting ahead in competitive programs, and wonder whether there are some more insidious ways people are helping their children (aside from lying that their kids are on sports teams lol). 

Two of my good friends at this school are pre-med and have extra time accommodations on exams due to test anxiety. Both come from wealthy East Coast families and both are VERY smart (I don’t think they would be at this school if they weren’t!). I am not pre-med so I don’t take the classes a huge portion of the undergraduate population does, but I obviously know and speak with a lot of pre-meds, and word always spreads like wildfire after chemistry tests, and the general consensus is always that they are insanely hard because everything is too rushed and many people don’t finish on time. My two friends, however, have never complained to me of this. At the beginning of the year, before I found out about their accommodations (I only found out because they were in the same class as me second semester and were not present in the exam room with me, so I asked where they were and they explained), I was just really in awe of how they could fly through an exam and get impeccable grades on them. Then after I learned about the accommodations, I found myself thinking “Oh, that explains it”.

My friends don’t seem like very anxious people, but I don’t want to speak too much on that, as I have an general anxiety diagnosis as well and I am fully aware that the face you present to the world does not necessarily correlate with your personal struggles. My issue is that both of my friends are pre-med. Both want to be surgeons. If they cannot complete a chemistry exam within the time given due to the undue stress it puts them under, how are they going to handle surgery, when someone’s very life is at risk? You can’t ask for extra time on that. 

I don’t think that accommodations based on test anxiety should never be allowed. I recognize that there are lots of jobs like engineers, computer scientists, businesspeople, etc. who do not perform their jobs under the same stressful conditions as a timed examination, and can simply work on whatever project they’ve been given at a slower pace, or whatever it may be. My issue is that some professions do not afford this, and so students should not be able to get these accommodations if they are studying to enter one of these professions. The jobs that comes to mind is surgeon/doctor, and a courtroom lawyer. If you cannot operate under stressful conditions, I don’t think you could do these jobs. 

It is because of my own anxiety that I am not pursuing a career in either of these fields, because I understand I am not cut out for these fields. I do not respond well to stress at all, and I know these demanding jobs would be a detriment both to me mentally and to whoever I was trying to help. This is fine, as there are a myriad of other jobs I can have. 

I guess it comes down to the fact that I, as an anxiety sufferer, cannot imagine that someone who gets so anxious while taking a written exam (that one can argue at the end of the day means very little) that they have to have extra time (one has double the time) to do it could even consider a profession where you have to make snap decisions about someone’s life. My friends do better on exams by virtue of the fact that they are no longer rushed and have time to complete and fully think through all the questions, so a part of me wonders whether the accommodation is just another way of keeping GPAs high for medical school. 

To me it feels like a blind person trying to become a surgeon, both have limitations that mean they are not suited for the job at hand. That’s totally okay, they can receive accommodations necessary to perform other jobs. I think that a student should be able to have accommodations for test anxiety or they should be able to pursue a high-stress career, but not both.

I believe that divorce laws in various parts of the world have a very outdated conception of the social role of women.

Many divorces favor women more. But times have changed.

And I will be referring to marriages between men and women here, but the logic would also fit into same-sex marriages.

Today, some families have women as their main provider, and there is no equal wage difference like the old times. A working woman is no longer frowned upon. There is no reason why unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement, the division of assets is divided equally, or there are more benefits in divorce for women. I believe that during a divorce, the amount of assets that each will have must equal the financial contribution of each one during the marriage and that should be the only factor to be taken into account.

Yes, I believe that housewives do not deserve to finish anything bought by the husband from a divorce. Psychological support is no longer a valid argument for anyone who is sustained in a society in which everyone can work. It is not just because she will end up with nothing that she deserves something she didn’t work to achieve.

Honestly, I have never heard of a divorce in which the woman ended up at a disadvantage that did not involve a well-written nuptial agreement that protected the man.

And children's pensions should also be reviewed. I believe that there should be a better control of the one who gives the money on the end that it will be destined. All money from these pensions should go to children.

I believe that women and feminism fought hard to reach the equality we enjoy in many parts of the world, and I believe that the way in which divorce is carried out has a vestige of an idea that women should be protected. The advantages we have during divorce must be eradicated to reflect our era.

,changemyview,"I’d like to preface this CMV by saying that not only am I open to changing my view, I’d also be willing to read any articles/books that might back up the opposite position. Also, I am a layman, I have no academic understanding of this subject, it is just a view that I keep returning to when Im faced with the the subject of ‘fixing society’.

Here goes: I believe that the common issues with our society, for example: climate change, wealth inequality, corruption and racism, stem from the idea that human nature ultimately creates a hierarchical structure in society. Those on ‘top’ (without realising or not) will end up maintaining/asserting their position through oppression and domination of those lower in the hierarchy. 

This structure is unsustainable in the world today because it allows those at the ‘top’ of the hierarchy to consume and hog resources in a way that will ultimately lead to resource depletion and the collapse of society. 

This unsustainability is what has lead to our current environmental crisis. The inequality that it creates fosters racism and hate. Corruption occurs because those at the ‘top’ do not want to lose their positions. There are other issues that exist as a result as well.

The reason I believe we cannot ‘fix’ society is because I think this hierarchical structure is built into our nature, and no matter what we do we will end up returning to this unsustainable society.

Efforts to change our society historically have resulted in a return to the hierarchy. Some examples: communism in Russia, socialism in Venezuela, and Chinese communism.

,changemyview,"It is no doubt that social media breed misinformation and conspiracy theories. Sites such as Facebook or Twitter are especially good at being a nesting ground for antivaxx, 5g lunatics, big pharma, etc. They keep on spreading their unfounded beliefs to their loyal fanbase. This is where the block user functionality sucks.

See, whenever a party wants to contrast their belief, they are immediately blocked. There is no way of pushing contrasting beliefs into a discussion, as you will just get blocked. This breeds echo-chambers, which are destructive, and lead to only more of conspiracies and idiocracy. Taking into consideration this, the block user function has a negative effect.However, I acknowledge that the function has been designed to help prevent doxxing, as well as insults, stalking and other harmful acts. Although the efficiency of blocking users in preventing insulting messages is not something that is entirely efficient, I can agree to assume that the block user function plays some role in preventing these acts. I also acknowledge that this was the reason it was designed. However, people abuse the power they have. Hence, I think that the function should be changed because it is used in a way that creates destructive communities and breeds echo-chambers.

Here is how I envision the change, however, this is obviously a matter that should be analyzed and considered by many, not a sole redditor. A person should have to choose the reason they are blocking someone. After they click ""block user"", there should be a prompt that asks for reason, such as for instance: ""the user is insulting"", ""the user is harassing"", ""doxxing"", ""spam"", etc. similarly to how a report function works. The user would then be blocked immediately, however, the claim would then be checked by a human supervisor, similarly to how it works with reports. Of course, all of these are matter to discussion. The reason it (In my opinion) should work this way is that there already exists the option to Mute a person on Twitter and Facebook, therefore, if a person does not want to see the comments, they can just mute the person. Nowadays, many users use ""block"" function instead of ""mute"", which means that they basically prevent their point from being contrasted by others (effectively breeding echo chambers).

Edit: I think I need to clarify that this post is about blocking, not muting. While muting means that you never see posts/comments from the person, blocking means that you disallow someone from ever responding to your posts, effectively preventing both yourself, as well as all your followers from seeing the post.",t2_lgrta,FALSE,,0,FALSE,"CMV: Social Media sites need to redesign ""block user"" functionality.",[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,FTFdelta,0,FALSE,t3_gfnhf9,FALSE,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},Delta(s) from OP - Fresh Topic Friday,FALSE,1,,FALSE,,1588923138,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588946421,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no doubt that social media breed misinformation and conspiracy theories.

,changemyview,"I'm a 37 years old male living in Argentina who has develop a strange anger and/or resent towards sports that I cannot overcome. It started in elementary school, and continued into high school. 20 years after I left high school I still have these feelings. I am also an asthmatic and these feeling are honestly damaging my personal development as an individual, even my health.

I was the classic nerd you have seen in the movies that was always the last to be picked on when I had physical education in school and we had to play multiple sports. In time I ""learned"" that I was inherently bad at sports but good with computers and somehow it seems I bought the idea that in order to be good in one thing you had to be bad in another. I remember PE class was terrible because even those who were my friends in class, dreaded to play in my team and often yelled at me during matches. In high school it got far worse, I was picked on not only by my classmates but even by my professor. I hated that guy's guts. We had to go on Wednesdays at 7AM to an open field that was right next to the ocean, in winter, only for him to give us a ball and tell us to play football (soccer). Of course everyone knew how to play but I didn't, they never taught us a single rule because apparently most Argentinians have this programmed into their DNA but it seems I did not. I was repeatedly humiliated by this 'professor', once he made me stood 15 minutes that seemed an eternity until I was able to get the ball on the other side of the net during volleyball class, while everyone laughed at me. 

When I went to college I was kind of surprised because I started meeting new, good people who loved the same things I did, but apparently many of them were fit and loved going to the gym or practicing sports like running or surfing. It seemed the stereotype, the personality pack that I had bought for so many years, wasn't real after all.

I have never been obese, i was a little overweight during short periods, but I have never been fit in my entire life. I think that if I could actually become fit and someday feel proud of my body I would just fall apart crying right in front of my mirror. I have done a little running and a little swimming in the past because I don't have that terrible memories about those activities, but \*every single time\* I do it I feel terrible. Like my inner voice tells me ""what the hell are you doing, don't you know this is not your thing, you're doing awful, this is absolutely pointless, you're not getting anywhere"". It doesn't help that I have never been able to appreciate positive physical changes in my body after exercising, probably because I have never done it more than two or three months in a row. My lifetime running record was 12km. I still remember how uncomfortable and out-of-place I felt each time I participated in 5km runs organized by my city. It honestly enrages me to hear people talking about how happy practicing sports will make you, as if all humans beings were made the same. I feel miserable each time I've done it, and the only reason I did it was because my hatred towards my body appearance was even stronger.

I know that sometimes people who post here don't really want to change their views but I'm not one of them. I realize how crippling this is in terms of my well being, but I can't flip a switch in my mind and start loving it.

This tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth. Controlling media and entertainment is how you control a culture or the way it thinks and acts. Disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet, but mark my words, there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by Disney to fit their idea of what it should be. 

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way. 

Disney owns too much and has the power to do too much. Let me make another example. Star Wars. I know, I know, “TLJ sucked, not canon! Duurrrrr!” I’m not here to bash the movies. I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that! Star Wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed, the rest could have done whatever it wanted! Here’s another one, Star Wars: Battlefront II the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco (gambling in games that kids can access). I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. 

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

,changemyview,"**Nihilism**

&gt;**Nihilism** is the point of view that suspends belief in any or all general aspects of human life, which are culturally accepted. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nihilism is useful as a starting point for an intellectual exercise to better understand a cultural concept. It is not, however, a sustainable philosophy to build a society around.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to form a functioning society, there must be an overarching culture that binds people together. This culture must be built from some axioms that can be used to orient that culture's direction of development over time. For example, western liberalism (most of western civilization) is built from the axioms that human life has intrinsic value and the individual is sacred. These are concepts that emerged from the enlightenment and were derived from Judaeo-Christian tradition. It is useful to take a nihilistic approach when analyzing these axioms, to instead question why these assertions are true rather than assuming they are true, but nihilism cannot provide the necessary foundation on which to form a society because it questions the very concept of an axiom. It is not a starting point from which a society can build a culture and orient its development.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hedonism**

&gt;**Hedonism** is a school of thought that argues seeking pleasure and avoiding suffering are the only components of well-being. Ethical hedonism is the view that combines hedonism with welfarist ethics, which claim that what we should do depends exclusively on what affects the well-being individuals have. Ethical hedonists would defend either increasing pleasure and reducing suffering for all beings capable of experiencing them, or just reducing suffering in the case of negative consequentialism. According to negative utilitarianism, only the minimization of suffering would matter. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedonism is unhealthy for a society two ways. The first being directly through the adoption of its tenants into culture, and the second being indirectly through the adoption of its tenants by individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

Directly adopting tenants of  hedonism into a culture poses one large problem: *There is no objective means by which to measure pleasure and suffering.* Firstly this is a logistical issue, if your goal is to reduce suffering, whose suffering takes priority and how is that determination made. You cannot reduce everyone's suffering simultaneously and equally. Secondly, this will inevitably cause conflict. What reduces one person's suffering might increase the suffering of another. What might be pleasurable for one could be suffering for another.

&amp;#x200B;

Individuals adopting hedonism as a personal philosophy also creates problems. In addition to the conflicts mentioned above, on a psychological level, some suffering is required to give life meaning. In he process of overcoming adversity in an attempt to achieve a higher goal, encountering adversity will always lead to some form of suffering. We are aware of this, and subconsciously we crave this adversity, we are always the hero in our own story, when there is no dragon to battle against we create our own to justify ourselves, most recently becoming evident in the concept of *first-world problems*. This idea I feel was best illustrated in Fyodor Dostoyevski's *Notes from the Underground:*

&gt;Even if man were nothing but a piano key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of sheer ingratitude, simply to have his own way…then, after all, perhaps only by his curse will he attain his object, that is, really convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key!

Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a 'Glow up'. I think this kind of attitude is just thinly veiled bitterness and jealousy that someone has acheived something fantastic that they are happy with and proud of.

Adele was always a great singer and performer and arguably pretty too but she looks amazing now and very happy and if people are congratulating her I think it's wonderful. The mental gymnastics of people that are suggesting she might have depression, a drug addiction or even cancer is just a pathetic attempt at finding excuses for why she was able to do something that others can't. And it's all false too because she has been very open for YEARS about wanting to lose weight for various reasons. She cut out sugar in her tea (true brit), hired a trainer and a nutritionist etc, she worked really really hard and its just sad people that can't be happy for her.

This kind of tweet and retweet is what I mean:  [https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454](https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454)

The first guy saying some stupid shit about her looking like a sorority girl about to marry into old money doesn't even make fucking sense, but the retweet is just as bad saying that people like fat people getting thin (and healthier) too much. The woman retweeting is extremely fat and openly trying to use that to make herself a model so she has a vested interest in being obese not being seen as the negative thing that it is.

I also think it is disingenous to suggest this isn't a 'glow up'. What is the actual definition? From what I've seen it's literally just pictures of people age 15-18 or something then them in their 20s all done up with makeup. The whole idea of a 'glow up' is already vapid and shallow and suggesting Adele's doesn't count when it looks more like it than most others just shows the disingenuous nature of these people's attitude.

Anyway, CMV?

Obviously it&amp;#39;s worse in his case because he&amp;#39;s the president and she&amp;#39;s just a senator, but that doesn&amp;#39;t explain why people would be rallying around her and &amp;quot;the squad&amp;quot; while whispering about an AOC bid for the presidency in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/) by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health. There are sometimes seem as a newer drug epidemic set to spar off with the opioid epidemic for it's debilitating effects on public health. 

Benzodiazapines are a class of minor tranquilizer/sedative drugs that are less potent than their older, less safe equivalent barbiturates. They act positive allostatic modulators of the GABA-subtype A receptor and it's various subtypes of binding cites. By pulling in an influx of negatively charged chloride ions, they inhibit the firing of a neuron, thereby decreasing brain activity globally. Alcohol works as a GABA agonist as well, and also antagonizes the common excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, from which GABA is synthesized. 

GABA says ""stop"", glutamate says ""go"". This will be an important dichotomy to bear in mind. Currently, benzodiazapines like Vallium (diazapam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Atavian (lorazepam) are classified under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as Schedule IV class drugs. By being a controlled substance, a drug's availability becomes subject to extra legislation that non-scheduled drugs are not. For instance, refills on classes III-V expire after six months from the time they are written, which is normally a year for unscheduled drugs. Schedule II drugs require a new prescription every refill, and cannot have automatic refills attached to them. Meaning your doctor must write a new one each month. Also in the case of Schedule II, no more than a 30 day supple of the drug can be prescribed on one prescription. Which means if you take it once a day, you get 30 max. Penalties for illegal possession are also higher.  

So, my case is that benzodiazapines, as well as the non-benzodiazapine hypnotic ""Z-drugs"" such as Ambien and Lunesta, should be reclassified from Schedule IV to Schedule II. My argument for this is that benzodiazapines are addictive, highly abusable, and deadly. Withdrawal can last months, if not years. Longer than opioid withdrawal by a country mile. Abuse and chronic use of Benzodiazapines can cause tolerance to build, resulting in the uncoupling and down-regulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation or increased genetic expression of NMDA receptors, the brain's main glutamate receptor. This creates excito-toxicity in the brain that can cause apoptosis (neuron cell death, often permanent in most areas of the brain), long term structural and functional disturbances, and most famous of all, seizures! None of that is pleasant. 

Now you might be thinking ""Well hang on, by adding extra regulations, couldn't that get many people taken off their medication?"" 

Yes, it might. But the few conditions benzodiazapines are FDA approved to treat (insomnia, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and epilepsy) are finding new and alternative treatments. Anxiety disorders have antidepressants, BuSpar, or just plain old exercise. Insomnia has antihistamines (including prescription ones), exercise, and improvements in sleep hygiene. The only disorders I stand by giving benzodiazapines to as a first line treatment is for panic disorder and epilepsy. Those conditions benefit far more from chronic treatment than does anxiety and sleep disorders, both of which have plenty of alternative treatment options. 

The dangers and risks of benzodiazapines are pretty apparent, so I advise you not disregard those factors when trying to change my view. Also, as I see a lot in drug-related debates, deflecting to another drug or issue is not a valid argument in my eyes. Yes, opioids are currently more deadly.

,changemyview,"Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don't believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I'm open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.

My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. 

From a religious perspective, I'm sure that I don't need to explain why you'd think there is an afterlife. I'm sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. 

My basic idea behind the possibility of an ""afterlife"" from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don't know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. 

Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. 

 You could make the argument that that isn't ""you"", that's a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that's a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of ""I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don't have a ""belief"" really either way, but it's not something I dismiss as easily as I've seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect. This idea is potentially supported by NDE's (anecdotal, I know) and the weird circumstances surrounding those. There's other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like ""How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?"" Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn't that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.

There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence. (Which I want to emphasize once again, I do consider to be a possibility. Just not the most likely one). 

I think reality is just strange and almost incoherent enough to suggest that if it happens once, it may continue to happen or happen again.

,changemyview,"In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

,changemyview,"I posted a CMV many weeks back proposing that the best way to a limited amount of relief funds was to give it directly to people and let them decide the best way for them to survive with it. This will reward businesses who are supplying the most direct needs and allow them to survive and even thrive and employ more people. The original post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fnkhw2/cmv_the_majority_of_government_economic_disaster/). Since that time, the U.S. federal government has given us a natural experiment in that it disbursed the majority of relief funds in three ways:

1. Directly to every taxpayer,
2. Unemployment subsidy (a semi-direct that goes through the state unemployment office), and
3. ""Payroll Protection Plan"" (PPP) where funds are given to business owners for them to pay employees their previous wages.

Let's look at the effectiveness of each one, starting with the unemployment subsidy. This took the form of a $600 per week addition on top of what somebody who lost their job and qualified for unemployment would get. This was fairly successful for persons who lost their jobs--25 million in just three weeks--and allowed them to keep feeding their families and pay rent and mortgages. This can be considered somewhat of a direct payment but it comes with a set of problems due to the fact that it went through the unemployment office, which I will address soon.

The next one to look at is the PPP, which paid businesses to keep people employed. This plan's problems and rollouts are well known. If you don't know the issues, you can read about it [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/04/07/ppp-loan-plan-rollout-disaster-small-businesses/2963901001/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/848389343/how-did-the-small-business-loan-program-have-so-many-problems-in-just-4-weeks). In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn't worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.

Another issue is that many employees were getting more money *not* to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work.

By far the best use of funds was the direct-to-taxpayer payment. Businesses all across the country saw immediate spikes in revenue starting the week that people got these funds. This is what has allowed them to bring employees back to work.

,changemyview,"For many reasons, reddit and other international platforms often focus on offered wage and other work-related elements. Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. 

When unemployment was at &gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. 

It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you'd see a clear rise in cases (and you'd be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.

To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.

When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you'll appreciate most. And to this day a company I can trust to pay, to pay what they say on paper, and to pay on time is highly, highly praised. All of those are still issues, and I'm sure will once again be at the forefront with the Covid-19   crisis. Personally I'd gladly earn a bit less and commute a bit more, (assuming you can get hired, that's a whole other can of worms) if I'm offered the option to work at one of the very very few companies that kept to the law at the times.

Note: of course, if all companies respect that, then you should move unto other criteria; but I think the first and foremost question should be this one, and only when you are certain a companies is trustworthy, should other factors matter - to assume this is automatically true is a bit arrogant. 

Note2: before someone says ""if you had skill and education then you wouldn't say this, just invest in yourself"" or ""if you weren't lazy and studied"": I have a Bachelor, will have an MS in a couple month and speak four languages fluently (plus my mother tongue).

And to this day a company I can trust to pay, to pay what they say on paper, and to pay on time is highly, highly praised. All of those are still issues, and I&amp;#39;m sure will once again be at the forefront with the Covid-19   crisis. Personally I&amp;#39;d gladly earn a bit less and commute a bit more, (assuming you can get hired, that&amp;#39;s a whole other can of worms) if I&amp;#39;m offered the option to work at one of the very very few companies that kept to the law at the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: of course, if all companies respect that, then you should move unto other criteria; but I think the first and foremost question should be this one, and only when you are certain a companies is trustworthy, should other factors matter - to assume this is automatically true is a bit arrogant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note2: before someone says &amp;quot;if you had skill and education then you wouldn&amp;#39;t say this, just invest in yourself&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;if you weren&amp;#39;t lazy and studied&amp;quot;: I have a Bachelor, will have an MS in a couple month and speak four languages fluently (plus my mother tongue). Also, before &amp;quot;useless degree&amp;quot;, my MS is in   STEM.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"So I'm someone who had studied 9 languages in my life, in school (university/HS), with private teachers and by myself, so I've come across books of both good and bad quality. Here is my experience so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Books from the '80s or '90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it's a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I've seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

Since so many of these books are ""trendy"" today (that is, used as official education material by schools), they actually worsen the quality of language studies for students of any kind. Worst of all, they charge actual money for these books and courses based on them, whereas better alternatives are widely available online, for free (without piracy, of course). My example is, again, Spanish. I'd learned Spanish in high school, and decided to start it again from scratch as it was 7 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending only one afternoon searching for materials online for self-study, I've found 2 websites, one of which is literally a very easy-to-understand, to-the-point encyclopedia with EVERYTHING related to Spanish grammar and words, and the other is a more structured learning site for the basics. I've also found no less than 5 YouTubers who are native Spanish teachers posting videos weekly, explaining all the nuances and points in Spanish grammar in a very easy-to-understand way with examples. So basically they provide more and more useful information in a (often) way more comprehensible manner than most of today's textbooks and courses (even some teachers), completely for free.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, being charged real-life money for books and (often, but not always) courses of sub-par quality, whereas within a few hours of searching (again, without illegal piracy), one can easily find MUCH better material for self-study, completely FREE.  


So, my opinion is that these books should either be regulated VERY strictly so that they actually have some use and contain quality material, or should be forced to be ""gettable"" for free, since they do not possess any inherent value considering the above-mentioned facts/alternatives. I'm sure the same applies to other (major) languages as well, not just to Spanish. What are your opinions?

,changemyview,"In 1947, conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India was so severe that there was no way to create a united India. Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.

Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn't. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.

With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent   
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. 

The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. 

With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.

Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.

Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn&amp;#39;t. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent&lt;br/&gt;
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"Women are vulnerable to terrible, tragic acts of violence. While men represent the largest number of victims in contrast to women, it is also proven that men are the usual perpetrators of said violence. So, when seen through the lens of gender, it is often assumed that when a man commits an act of violence against a woman, it is not only gender related, but gender motivated, gender reasoned, gender intentioned. As the maxim dictates, it was committed specifically because they are female.

But violence is —as anything human— a very complex phenomenon. Why do men commit more violent crimes? Is it biological? Is it cultural? Where they not raised properly? Did their moms hate them? Do they have an inner desire to hurt the opposite sex, fueled by hours watching football games and going to Hooters? The motivations for an individual to commit violent acts are no simple matter, yet we pretend to know what is happening inside the mind of a criminal. That is an oversimplification that keeps us from learning about the criminal mind, about the violent mind, the human mind, about the hidden motivations that stir inside an individual that more than simply being a man, is a dissident member of civilization.

It is not my intention to argue that gender violence does not exist, it would be naïve from me to assume that women have not lived pain and suffering caused by other human beings strictly because they are women. But it is unacceptable to make the armchair assumption that when a woman’s rights are violated, it was strictly because of gender norms. Yes, gender is a factor that must be evaluated, as many other factors should be considered. But to assume that a person is motivated strictly because of it blinds us from understanding what is ticking inside a perpetrator, and understanding those motivations is paramount if we want to prevent other human beings —including ourselves— from following a path of horror.

Example: women are physically weaker and more vulnerable than men. An individual with the intent of causing physical harm  —which is a mystery, by itself, not easy to solve— to another could look for any vulnerable victim, targeting physically weaker individuals or socially and legally under protected minorities, since he or she could not be particularly interested in engaging in a physical challenge ([Richard Ramirez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), [Juana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Barraza), to name a few). In this scenario, the motivation for a crime could transcend gender. If a strong, mentally disturbed man assaults a weak, vulnerable woman and we assume it was a gender motivated crime, we could be asking the wrong questions.

The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on *machismo* and *the patriarchy*, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.

,changemyview,"Before I continue on with explaining why I have this view, I would like to point out that I think life is common. There may be some alien microbes and a few plants and animal like life forms here and there. But I bet we are the only intelligent life forms. We are the only species in the universe that is capable of making a civilization.

Now I would like to explain why I believe this. There was a physicist named Enrico Fermi. I don’t remember where I read this, but I believe the highest estimated amount of advanced civilizations in the galaxy that Fermi calculated was up to 10000 civilizations. If that was case, we should’ve seen evidence of extraterrestrials colonizing the galaxy several times. We don’t see any evidence and this is where the Fermi paradox comes in. We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out. Surely, there had to have evolved at least one species of where their inherent nature wouldn’t have ultimately destroyed themselves. The rest of the solutions to the paradox I’ve heard are just things that would distract a species from colonizing the galaxy such as the civilization was trapped in a virtual world sort of like the movie Ready player one of you want to compare these two situations in any way. I’m also highly skeptical of those situations. The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies. I am open to some hypothetical situations like us being in a zoo or aliens trying to hide from us because we aren’t ready for extraterrestrial contact.

There may be some alien microbes and a few plants and animal like life forms here and there. But I bet we are the only intelligent life forms. We are the only species in the universe that is capable of making a civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to explain why I believe this. There was a physicist named Enrico Fermi. I don’t remember where I read this, but I believe the highest estimated amount of advanced civilizations in the galaxy that Fermi calculated was up to 10000 civilizations. If that was case, we should’ve seen evidence of extraterrestrials colonizing the galaxy several times. We don’t see any evidence and this is where the Fermi paradox comes in. We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out. Surely, there had to have evolved at least one species of where their inherent nature wouldn’t have ultimately destroyed themselves. The rest of the solutions to the paradox I’ve heard are just things that would distract a species from colonizing the galaxy such as the civilization was trapped in a virtual world sort of like the movie Ready player one of you want to compare these two situations in any way. I’m also highly skeptical of those situations. The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies. I am open to some hypothetical situations like us being in a zoo or aliens trying to hide from us because we aren’t ready for extraterrestrial contact. I find these highly unlikely though, but I guess I have to remain open to some strange possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don't believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I'm open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.

My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. 

From a religious perspective, I'm sure that I don't need to explain why you'd think there is an afterlife. I'm sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. 

My basic idea behind the possibility of an ""afterlife"" from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don't know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. 

Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. 

 You could make the argument that that isn't ""you"", that's a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that's a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of ""I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don't have a ""belief"" really either way, but it's not something I dismiss as easily as I've seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect. This idea is potentially supported by NDE's (anecdotal, I know) and the weird circumstances surrounding those. There's other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like ""How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?"" Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn't that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.

There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence.

Thank you all, I can't wait to read the replies.",t2_3ktrs6xg,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: I think nothing happening after death is unlikely,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,OPdelta,0,FALSE,t3_ge7p8m,FALSE,dark,0.55,,public,2,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},Delta(s) from OP,FALSE,2,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588746596,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don&amp;#39;t believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I&amp;#39;m open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a religious perspective, I&amp;#39;m sure that I don&amp;#39;t need to explain why you&amp;#39;d think there is an afterlife. I&amp;#39;m sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic idea behind the possibility of an &amp;quot;afterlife&amp;quot; from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don&amp;#39;t know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could make the argument that that isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that&amp;#39;s a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of &amp;quot;I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;belief&amp;quot; really either way, but it&amp;#39;s not something I dismiss as easily as I&amp;#39;ve seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect. This idea is potentially supported by NDE&amp;#39;s (anecdotal, I know) and the weird circumstances surrounding those. There&amp;#39;s other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like &amp;quot;How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?&amp;quot; Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn&amp;#39;t that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence. (Which I want to emphasize once again, I do consider to be a possibility. Just not the most likely one). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think reality is just strange and almost incoherent enough to suggest that if it happens once, it may continue to happen or happen again. &lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"One of the main arguments i’ve seen for why leftists should vote for Biden over Trump (and the only one I find convincing) is that a Trump victory in 2020 almost certainly means a conservative Supreme Court for at least a decade, as Justices Breyer and Ginsburg will likely leave the court in the next few years.

In the wake of this, or the public perception that Joe Biden is not mentally sound, Mitch McConnell could very well refuse to hold a vote on any liberal nominee.

,changemyview,"In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

,changemyview,"I posted a CMV many weeks back proposing that the best way to a limited amount of relief funds was to give it directly to people and let them decide the best way for them to survive with it. This will reward businesses who are supplying the most direct needs and allow them to survive and even thrive and employ more people. The original post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fnkhw2/cmv_the_majority_of_government_economic_disaster/). Since that time, the U.S. federal government has given us a natural experiment in that it disbursed the majority of relief funds in three ways:

1. Directly to every taxpayer,
2. Unemployment subsidy (a semi-direct that goes through the state unemployment office), and
3. ""Payroll Protection Plan"" (PPP) where funds are given to business owners for them to pay employees their previous wages.

Let's look at the effectiveness of each one, starting with the unemployment subsidy. This took the form of a $600 per week addition on top of what somebody who lost their job and qualified for unemployment would get. This was fairly successful for persons who lost their jobs--25 million in just three weeks--and allowed them to keep feeding their families and pay rent and mortgages. This can be considered somewhat of a direct payment but it comes with a set of problems due to the fact that it went through the unemployment office, which I will address soon.

The next one to look at is the PPP, which paid businesses to keep people employed. This plan's problems and rollouts are well known. If you don't know the issues, you can read about it [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/04/07/ppp-loan-plan-rollout-disaster-small-businesses/2963901001/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/848389343/how-did-the-small-business-loan-program-have-so-many-problems-in-just-4-weeks). In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn't worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.

Another issue is that many employees were getting more money *not* to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work.

,changemyview,"For many reasons, reddit and other international platforms often focus on offered wage and other work-related elements. Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. 

When unemployment was at &gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. 

It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you'd see a clear rise in cases (and you'd be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.

To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.

When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you'll appreciate most.

,changemyview,"So I'm someone who had studied 9 languages in my life, in school (university/HS), with private teachers and by myself, so I've come across books of both good and bad quality. Here is my experience so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Books from the '80s or '90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it's a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I've seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

Since so many of these books are ""trendy"" today (that is, used as official education material by schools), they actually worsen the quality of language studies for students of any kind. Worst of all, they charge actual money for these books and courses based on them, whereas better alternatives are widely available online, for free (without piracy, of course). My example is, again, Spanish. I'd learned Spanish in high school, and decided to start it again from scratch as it was 7 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending only one afternoon searching for materials online for self-study, I've found 2 websites, one of which is literally a very easy-to-understand, to-the-point encyclopedia with EVERYTHING related to Spanish grammar and words, and the other is a more structured learning site for the basics. I've also found no less than 5 YouTubers who are native Spanish teachers posting videos weekly, explaining all the nuances and points in Spanish grammar in a very easy-to-understand way with examples. So basically they provide more and more useful information in a (often) way more comprehensible manner than most of today's textbooks and courses (even some teachers), completely for free.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, being charged real-life money for books and (often, but not always) courses of sub-par quality, whereas within a few hours of searching (again, without illegal piracy), one can easily find MUCH better material for self-study, completely FREE.  


So, my opinion is that these books should either be regulated VERY strictly so that they actually have some use and contain quality material, or should be forced to be ""gettable"" for free, since they do not possess any inherent value considering the above-mentioned facts/alternatives. I'm sure the same applies to other (major) languages as well, not just to Spanish. What are your opinions?

,changemyview,"In 1947, conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India was so severe that there was no way to create a united India. Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.

Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn't. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.

With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent   
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. 

The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. 

With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.

Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.

,changemyview,"Women are vulnerable to terrible, tragic acts of violence. While men represent the largest number of victims in contrast to women, it is also proven that men are the usual perpetrators of said violence. So, when seen through the lens of gender, it is often assumed that when a man commits an act of violence against a woman, it is not only gender related, but gender motivated, gender reasoned, gender intentioned. As the maxim dictates, it was committed specifically because they are female.

But violence is —as anything human— a very complex phenomenon. Why do men commit more violent crimes? Is it biological? Is it cultural? Where they not raised properly? Did their moms hate them? Do they have an inner desire to hurt the opposite sex, fueled by hours watching football games and going to Hooters? The motivations for an individual to commit violent acts are no simple matter, yet we pretend to know what is happening inside the mind of a criminal. That is an oversimplification that keeps us from learning about the criminal mind, about the violent mind, the human mind, about the hidden motivations that stir inside an individual that more than simply being a man, is a dissident member of civilization.

It is not my intention to argue that gender violence does not exist, it would be naïve from me to assume that women have not lived pain and suffering caused by other human beings strictly because they are women. But it is unacceptable to make the armchair assumption that when a woman’s rights are violated, it was strictly because of gender norms. Yes, gender is a factor that must be evaluated, as many other factors should be considered. But to assume that a person is motivated strictly because of it blinds us from understanding what is ticking inside a perpetrator, and understanding those motivations is paramount if we want to prevent other human beings —including ourselves— from following a path of horror.

Example: women are physically weaker and more vulnerable than men. An individual with the intent of causing physical harm  —which is a mystery, by itself, not easy to solve— to another could look for any vulnerable victim, targeting physically weaker individuals or socially and legally under protected minorities, since he or she could not be particularly interested in engaging in a physical challenge ([Richard Ramirez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), [Juana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Barraza), to name a few). In this scenario, the motivation for a crime could transcend gender. If a strong, mentally disturbed man assaults a weak, vulnerable woman and we assume it was a gender motivated crime, we could be asking the wrong questions.

The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on *machismo* and *the patriarchy*, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.

On the national level, though, I don't see how this is a concern. Is China going to engage in a ground war to collect on their debt? Japan, our close ally and 2nd largest holder of our debt, definitely won't.  In my understanding, it also keeps the U.S. dollar strong, because if the dollar weakens, then all the debt other countries have bought becomes worthless.

&lt;p&gt;Most people hear the word &amp;quot;debt&amp;quot; and think about their own debt - student loans, mortgages, medical bills - and the bad and scary things that can happen in their lives if they don&amp;#39;t pay off the debt. On the national level, though, I don&amp;#39;t see how this is a concern. Is China going to engage in a ground war to collect on their debt? Japan, our close ally and 2nd largest holder of our debt, definitely won&amp;#39;t.  In my understanding, it also keeps the U.S. dollar strong, because if the dollar weakens, then all the debt other countries have bought becomes worthless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;m not saying that we should recklessly increase the debt, or that any given spending program is totally fine. I&amp;#39;m just saying &amp;quot;it will raise the debt&amp;quot; is on its own not a sufficient nor compelling argument against, say, Medicare for All. CMV!&lt;/p&gt;

There may be some alien microbes and a few plants and animal like life forms here and there. But I bet we are the only intelligent life forms. We are the only species in the universe that is capable of making a civilization.

Now I would like to explain why I believe this. There was a physicist named Enrico Fermi. I don’t remember where I read this, but I believe the highest estimated amount of advanced civilizations in the galaxy that Fermi calculated was up to 10000 civilizations. If that was case, we should’ve seen evidence of extraterrestrials colonizing the galaxy several times. We don’t see any evidence and this is where the Fermi paradox comes in. We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out. Surely, there had to have evolved at least one species of where their inherent nature wouldn’t have ultimately destroyed themselves. The rest of the solutions to the paradox I’ve heard are just things that would distract a species from colonizing the galaxy such as the civilization was trapped in a virtual world sort of like the movie Ready player one of you want to compare these two situations in any way. I’m also highly skeptical of those situations. The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies. I am open to some hypothetical situations like us being in a zoo or aliens trying to hide from us because we aren’t ready for extraterrestrial contact. I find these highly unlikely though, but I guess I have to remain open to some strange possibilities.

,changemyview,"Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don't believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I'm open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.

My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. 

From a religious perspective, I'm sure that I don't need to explain why you'd think there is an afterlife. I'm sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. 

My basic idea behind the possibility of an ""afterlife"" from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don't know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. 

Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. 

 You could make the argument that that isn't ""you"", that's a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that's a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of ""I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don't have a ""belief"" really either way, but it's not something I dismiss as easily as I've seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect. This idea is potentially supported by NDE's (anecdotal, I know) and the weird circumstances surrounding those. There's other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like ""How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?"" Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn't that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.

There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence. (Which I want to emphasize once again, I do consider to be a possibility. Just not the most likely one). 

I think reality is just strange and almost incoherent enough to suggest that if it happens once, it may continue to happen or happen again.

In the wake of this, or the public perception that Joe Biden is not mentally sound, Mitch McConnell could very well refuse to hold a vote on any liberal nominee.

,changemyview,"In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

,changemyview,"I posted a CMV many weeks back proposing that the best way to a limited amount of relief funds was to give it directly to people and let them decide the best way for them to survive with it. This will reward businesses who are supplying the most direct needs and allow them to survive and even thrive and employ more people. The original post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fnkhw2/cmv_the_majority_of_government_economic_disaster/). Since that time, the U.S. federal government has given us a natural experiment in that it disbursed the majority of relief funds in three ways:

1. Directly to every taxpayer,
2. Unemployment subsidy (a semi-direct that goes through the state unemployment office), and
3. ""Payroll Protection Plan"" (PPP) where funds are given to business owners for them to pay employees their previous wages.

Let's look at the effectiveness of each one, starting with the unemployment subsidy. This took the form of a $600 per week addition on top of what somebody who lost their job and qualified for unemployment would get. This was fairly successful for persons who lost their jobs--25 million in just three weeks--and allowed them to keep feeding their families and pay rent and mortgages. This can be considered somewhat of a direct payment but it comes with a set of problems due to the fact that it went through the unemployment office, which I will address soon.

The next one to look at is the PPP, which paid businesses to keep people employed. This plan's problems and rollouts are well known. If you don't know the issues, you can read about it [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/04/07/ppp-loan-plan-rollout-disaster-small-businesses/2963901001/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/848389343/how-did-the-small-business-loan-program-have-so-many-problems-in-just-4-weeks). In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn't worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.

Another issue is that many employees were getting more money *not* to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work.

By far the best use of funds was the direct-to-taxpayer payment. Businesses all across the country saw immediate spikes in revenue starting the week that people got these funds. This is what has allowed them to bring employees back to work.

,changemyview,"For many reasons, reddit and other international platforms often focus on offered wage and other work-related elements. Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. 

When unemployment was at &gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. 

It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you'd see a clear rise in cases (and you'd be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.

To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.

When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you'll appreciate most.

Note: of course, if all companies respect that, then you should move unto other criteria; but I think the first and foremost question should be this one, and only when you are certain a companies is trustworthy, should other factors matter - to assume this is automatically true is a bit arrogant.

,changemyview,"So I'm someone who had studied 9 languages in my life, in school (university/HS), with private teachers and by myself, so I've come across books of both good and bad quality. Here is my experience so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Books from the '80s or '90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it's a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I've seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.

Since so many of these books are ""trendy"" today (that is, used as official education material by schools), they actually worsen the quality of language studies for students of any kind. Worst of all, they charge actual money for these books and courses based on them, whereas better alternatives are widely available online, for free (without piracy, of course). My example is, again, Spanish. I'd learned Spanish in high school, and decided to start it again from scratch as it was 7 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending only one afternoon searching for materials online for self-study, I've found 2 websites, one of which is literally a very easy-to-understand, to-the-point encyclopedia with EVERYTHING related to Spanish grammar and words, and the other is a more structured learning site for the basics. I've also found no less than 5 YouTubers who are native Spanish teachers posting videos weekly, explaining all the nuances and points in Spanish grammar in a very easy-to-understand way with examples. So basically they provide more and more useful information in a (often) way more comprehensible manner than most of today's textbooks and courses (even some teachers), completely for free.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, being charged real-life money for books and (often, but not always) courses of sub-par quality, whereas within a few hours of searching (again, without illegal piracy), one can easily find MUCH better material for self-study, completely FREE.  


So, my opinion is that these books should either be regulated VERY strictly so that they actually have some use and contain quality material, or should be forced to be ""gettable"" for free, since they do not possess any inherent value considering the above-mentioned facts/alternatives. I'm sure the same applies to other (major) languages as well, not just to Spanish. What are your opinions?

Here is my experience so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books from the &amp;#39;80s or &amp;#39;90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it&amp;#39;s a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I&amp;#39;ve seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"In 1947, conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India was so severe that there was no way to create a united India. Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.

Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn't. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.

With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent   
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. 

The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. 

With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.

Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.

,changemyview,"Women are vulnerable to terrible, tragic acts of violence. While men represent the largest number of victims in contrast to women, it is also proven that men are the usual perpetrators of said violence. So, when seen through the lens of gender, it is often assumed that when a man commits an act of violence against a woman, it is not only gender related, but gender motivated, gender reasoned, gender intentioned. As the maxim dictates, it was committed specifically because they are female.

But violence is —as anything human— a very complex phenomenon. Why do men commit more violent crimes? Is it biological? Is it cultural? Where they not raised properly? Did their moms hate them? Do they have an inner desire to hurt the opposite sex, fueled by hours watching football games and going to Hooters? The motivations for an individual to commit violent acts are no simple matter, yet we pretend to know what is happening inside the mind of a criminal. That is an oversimplification that keeps us from learning about the criminal mind, about the violent mind, the human mind, about the hidden motivations that stir inside an individual that more than simply being a man, is a dissident member of civilization.

It is not my intention to argue that gender violence does not exist, it would be naïve from me to assume that women have not lived pain and suffering caused by other human beings strictly because they are women. But it is unacceptable to make the armchair assumption that when a woman’s rights are violated, it was strictly because of gender norms. Yes, gender is a factor that must be evaluated, as many other factors should be considered. But to assume that a person is motivated strictly because of it blinds us from understanding what is ticking inside a perpetrator, and understanding those motivations is paramount if we want to prevent other human beings —including ourselves— from following a path of horror.

Example: women are physically weaker and more vulnerable than men. An individual with the intent of causing physical harm  —which is a mystery, by itself, not easy to solve— to another could look for any vulnerable victim, targeting physically weaker individuals or socially and legally under protected minorities, since he or she could not be particularly interested in engaging in a physical challenge ([Richard Ramirez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), [Juana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Barraza), to name a few). In this scenario, the motivation for a crime could transcend gender. If a strong, mentally disturbed man assaults a weak, vulnerable woman and we assume it was a gender motivated crime, we could be asking the wrong questions.

The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on *machismo* and *the patriarchy*, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.

There may be some alien microbes and a few plants and animal like life forms here and there. But I bet we are the only intelligent life forms. We are the only species in the universe that is capable of making a civilization.

Now I would like to explain why I believe this. There was a physicist named Enrico Fermi. I don’t remember where I read this, but I believe the highest estimated amount of advanced civilizations in the galaxy that Fermi calculated was up to 10000 civilizations. If that was case, we should’ve seen evidence of extraterrestrials colonizing the galaxy several times. We don’t see any evidence and this is where the Fermi paradox comes in. We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out. Surely, there had to have evolved at least one species of where their inherent nature wouldn’t have ultimately destroyed themselves. The rest of the solutions to the paradox I’ve heard are just things that would distract a species from colonizing the galaxy such as the civilization was trapped in a virtual world sort of like the movie Ready player one of you want to compare these two situations in any way. I’m also highly skeptical of those situations. The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies. I am open to some hypothetical situations like us being in a zoo or aliens trying to hide from us because we aren’t ready for extraterrestrial contact. I find these highly unlikely though, but I guess I have to remain open to some strange possibilities.

Every time theres a video of a cop doing something **good** (or even just a picture of a police puppy in training or something) you'll still find people saying ""ACAB"" or asking who police killed now because apparently there's a belief that such videos are part of a coordinated ""copaganda"" conspiracy to cover up police misconduct elsewhere. 

All the leftist subreddits small and large are de facto anti-cop subreddits and then there are dedicated anti-cop subs like r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut. 

I've been on reddit for years and have never sought to defend the malignant behavior of any individual police officer but have just calmly suggested maybe the hate for the entire institution is unwarranted and generally get met with downvotes and insults like ""bootlicker,"" and yet in all my years hearing anti-cop rhetoric on reddit I have yet to hear a really convincing reason why we should condemn the entire institution and every police officer in it. Most hate against police officers seems to be entirely based on anecdotal evidence or statistics showing that *some* police are bad actors.

I think this issue is exacerbated by the media who will focus in on cases of police misconduct (or even just controversial issues where their actions where justified, like the shooting of Michael Brown) and for *years* after the fact and hype it up because they know very well that police controversies sell. 

To be perfectly honest, the lack of any coherent reason to hate police makes the more cynical side of me wonder if all these flawed justifications for hating police are really just motivated by cops having busted redditors speeding or smoking weed or whatever years ago and, knowing that's not a rational reason to hate all police, the whole anti-cop narrative was constructed to cover for it.

&lt;p&gt;Every time theres a video of a cop doing something &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; (or even just a picture of a police puppy in training or something) you&amp;#39;ll still find people saying &amp;quot;ACAB&amp;quot; or asking who police killed now because apparently there&amp;#39;s a belief that such videos are part of a coordinated &amp;quot;copaganda&amp;quot; conspiracy to cover up police misconduct elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don't believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I'm open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.

My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. 

From a religious perspective, I'm sure that I don't need to explain why you'd think there is an afterlife. I'm sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. 

My basic idea behind the possibility of an ""afterlife"" from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don't know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. 

Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. 

 You could make the argument that that isn't ""you"", that's a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that's a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of ""I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don't have a ""belief"" really either way, but it's not something I dismiss as easily as I've seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect. This idea is potentially supported by NDE's (anecdotal, I know) and the weird circumstances surrounding those. There's other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like ""How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?"" Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn't that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.

There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence. (Which I want to emphasize once again, I do consider to be a possibility. Just not the most likely one). 

I think reality is just strange and almost incoherent enough to suggest that if it happens once, it may continue to happen or happen again.

,changemyview,"In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

Q.E.D.",t2_nccrm,FALSE,,0,FALSE,"CMV: The Terminator, i.e. the T-101 and/or the T-800, are NOT cyborgs!",[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,OPdelta,0,FALSE,t3_ge2dbn,FALSE,dark,0.67,,public,3,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},Delta(s) from OP,FALSE,3,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588729409,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it&amp;#39;s a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it&amp;#39;s living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human &amp;quot;flesh&amp;quot; are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; its &amp;quot;flesh&amp;quot; to survive.

,changemyview,"I posted a CMV many weeks back proposing that the best way to a limited amount of relief funds was to give it directly to people and let them decide the best way for them to survive with it. This will reward businesses who are supplying the most direct needs and allow them to survive and even thrive and employ more people. The original post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fnkhw2/cmv_the_majority_of_government_economic_disaster/). Since that time, the U.S. federal government has given us a natural experiment in that it disbursed the majority of relief funds in three ways:

1. Directly to every taxpayer,
2. Unemployment subsidy (a semi-direct that goes through the state unemployment office), and
3. ""Payroll Protection Plan"" (PPP) where funds are given to business owners for them to pay employees their previous wages.

Let's look at the effectiveness of each one, starting with the unemployment subsidy. This took the form of a $600 per week addition on top of what somebody who lost their job and qualified for unemployment would get. This was fairly successful for persons who lost their jobs--25 million in just three weeks--and allowed them to keep feeding their families and pay rent and mortgages. This can be considered somewhat of a direct payment but it comes with a set of problems due to the fact that it went through the unemployment office, which I will address soon.

The next one to look at is the PPP, which paid businesses to keep people employed. This plan's problems and rollouts are well known. If you don't know the issues, you can read about it [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/04/07/ppp-loan-plan-rollout-disaster-small-businesses/2963901001/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/848389343/how-did-the-small-business-loan-program-have-so-many-problems-in-just-4-weeks). In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn't worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.

Another issue is that many employees were getting more money *not* to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work.

By far the best use of funds was the direct-to-taxpayer payment. Businesses all across the country saw immediate spikes in revenue starting the week that people got these funds. This is what has allowed them to bring employees back to work.

,changemyview,"For many reasons, reddit and other international platforms often focus on offered wage and other work-related elements. Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. 

When unemployment was at &gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. 

It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you'd see a clear rise in cases (and you'd be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.

To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.

When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you'll appreciate most.

,changemyview,"So I'm someone who had studied 9 languages in my life, in school (university/HS), with private teachers and by myself, so I've come across books of both good and bad quality. Here is my experience so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Books from the '80s or '90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it's a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I've seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

Since so many of these books are ""trendy"" today (that is, used as official education material by schools), they actually worsen the quality of language studies for students of any kind. Worst of all, they charge actual money for these books and courses based on them, whereas better alternatives are widely available online, for free (without piracy, of course). My example is, again, Spanish. I'd learned Spanish in high school, and decided to start it again from scratch as it was 7 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending only one afternoon searching for materials online for self-study, I've found 2 websites, one of which is literally a very easy-to-understand, to-the-point encyclopedia with EVERYTHING related to Spanish grammar and words, and the other is a more structured learning site for the basics. I've also found no less than 5 YouTubers who are native Spanish teachers posting videos weekly, explaining all the nuances and points in Spanish grammar in a very easy-to-understand way with examples. So basically they provide more and more useful information in a (often) way more comprehensible manner than most of today's textbooks and courses (even some teachers), completely for free.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, being charged real-life money for books and (often, but not always) courses of sub-par quality, whereas within a few hours of searching (again, without illegal piracy), one can easily find MUCH better material for self-study, completely FREE.  


So, my opinion is that these books should either be regulated VERY strictly so that they actually have some use and contain quality material, or should be forced to be ""gettable"" for free, since they do not possess any inherent value considering the above-mentioned facts/alternatives. I'm sure the same applies to other (major) languages as well, not just to Spanish. What are your opinions?

,changemyview,"In 1947, conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India was so severe that there was no way to create a united India. Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.

Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn't. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.

With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent   
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. 

The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. 

With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.

Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.

,changemyview,"Women are vulnerable to terrible, tragic acts of violence. While men represent the largest number of victims in contrast to women, it is also proven that men are the usual perpetrators of said violence. So, when seen through the lens of gender, it is often assumed that when a man commits an act of violence against a woman, it is not only gender related, but gender motivated, gender reasoned, gender intentioned. As the maxim dictates, it was committed specifically because they are female.

But violence is —as anything human— a very complex phenomenon. Why do men commit more violent crimes? Is it biological? Is it cultural? Where they not raised properly? Did their moms hate them? Do they have an inner desire to hurt the opposite sex, fueled by hours watching football games and going to Hooters? The motivations for an individual to commit violent acts are no simple matter, yet we pretend to know what is happening inside the mind of a criminal. That is an oversimplification that keeps us from learning about the criminal mind, about the violent mind, the human mind, about the hidden motivations that stir inside an individual that more than simply being a man, is a dissident member of civilization.

It is not my intention to argue that gender violence does not exist, it would be naïve from me to assume that women have not lived pain and suffering caused by other human beings strictly because they are women. But it is unacceptable to make the armchair assumption that when a woman’s rights are violated, it was strictly because of gender norms. Yes, gender is a factor that must be evaluated, as many other factors should be considered. But to assume that a person is motivated strictly because of it blinds us from understanding what is ticking inside a perpetrator, and understanding those motivations is paramount if we want to prevent other human beings —including ourselves— from following a path of horror.

Example: women are physically weaker and more vulnerable than men. An individual with the intent of causing physical harm  —which is a mystery, by itself, not easy to solve— to another could look for any vulnerable victim, targeting physically weaker individuals or socially and legally under protected minorities, since he or she could not be particularly interested in engaging in a physical challenge ([Richard Ramirez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), [Juana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Barraza), to name a few). In this scenario, the motivation for a crime could transcend gender. If a strong, mentally disturbed man assaults a weak, vulnerable woman and we assume it was a gender motivated crime, we could be asking the wrong questions.

The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on *machismo* and *the patriarchy*, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.

There may be some alien microbes and a few plants and animal like life forms here and there. But I bet we are the only intelligent life forms.

Now I would like to explain why I believe this. There was a physicist named Enrico Fermi.

We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out.

The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies.

,changemyview,"The United State's two party system used to be applauded for its winner-take-all approach. One party wouldn't be elected if they ignored the needs and wants of the other party, so it seemed like a system that would force politicians to think about the country as a whole. And yet, the polarization between political parties has made it difficult to meet the needs and wants of everyone. Regardless of your political opinion, it is obvious that tensions are high and EVERY SINGLE issue is turned into a political one. The most basic humanitarian ideals are being politicized all because of the two-party system. While abolishing them wouldn't fix anything (because politics are always going to suck in some fashion) it would lessen the need to align wholeheartedly with one party and platform.

,changemyview,"Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don't believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I'm open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.

My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. 

From a religious perspective, I'm sure that I don't need to explain why you'd think there is an afterlife. I'm sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. 

My basic idea behind the possibility of an ""afterlife"" from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don't know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. 

Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. 

 You could make the argument that that isn't ""you"", that's a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that's a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of ""I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don't have a ""belief"" really either way, but it's not something I dismiss as easily as I've seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect. This idea is potentially supported by NDE's (anecdotal, I know) and the weird circumstances surrounding those. There's other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like ""How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?"" Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn't that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.

There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence. (Which I want to emphasize once again, I do consider to be a possibility. Just not the most likely one).

As you get older, you realize drugs are not on the same level, but you have no experience with them, so what’s supposed to be where? The DEA should know, right?

You go check the laws, and weed is on the same level as heroin. The highest, and worst level, along with LSD and magic mushrooms. Coke and meth are “safer” according to the Government, being only schedule 2.

,changemyview,"In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

,changemyview,"I posted a CMV many weeks back proposing that the best way to a limited amount of relief funds was to give it directly to people and let them decide the best way for them to survive with it. This will reward businesses who are supplying the most direct needs and allow them to survive and even thrive and employ more people. The original post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fnkhw2/cmv_the_majority_of_government_economic_disaster/). Since that time, the U.S. federal government has given us a natural experiment in that it disbursed the majority of relief funds in three ways:

1. Directly to every taxpayer,
2. Unemployment subsidy (a semi-direct that goes through the state unemployment office), and
3. ""Payroll Protection Plan"" (PPP) where funds are given to business owners for them to pay employees their previous wages.

Let's look at the effectiveness of each one, starting with the unemployment subsidy. This took the form of a $600 per week addition on top of what somebody who lost their job and qualified for unemployment would get. This was fairly successful for persons who lost their jobs--25 million in just three weeks--and allowed them to keep feeding their families and pay rent and mortgages. This can be considered somewhat of a direct payment but it comes with a set of problems due to the fact that it went through the unemployment office, which I will address soon.

The next one to look at is the PPP, which paid businesses to keep people employed. This plan's problems and rollouts are well known. If you don't know the issues, you can read about it [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/04/07/ppp-loan-plan-rollout-disaster-small-businesses/2963901001/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/848389343/how-did-the-small-business-loan-program-have-so-many-problems-in-just-4-weeks). In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn't worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.

Another issue is that many employees were getting more money *not* to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work.

By far the best use of funds was the direct-to-taxpayer payment. Businesses all across the country saw immediate spikes in revenue starting the week that people got these funds. This is what has allowed them to bring employees back to work.

,changemyview,"For many reasons, reddit and other international platforms often focus on offered wage and other work-related elements. Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. 

When unemployment was at &gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. 

It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you'd see a clear rise in cases (and you'd be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.

To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.

When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you'll appreciate most. And to this day a company I can trust to pay, to pay what they say on paper, and to pay on time is highly, highly praised. All of those are still issues, and I'm sure will once again be at the forefront with the Covid-19   crisis. Personally I'd gladly earn a bit less and commute a bit more, (assuming you can get hired, that's a whole other can of worms) if I'm offered the option to work at one of the very very few companies that kept to the law at the times.

Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When unemployment was at &amp;gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you&amp;#39;d see a clear rise in cases (and you&amp;#39;d be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you&amp;#39;ll appreciate most. And to this day a company I can trust to pay, to pay what they say on paper, and to pay on time is highly, highly praised. All of those are still issues, and I&amp;#39;m sure will once again be at the forefront with the Covid-19   crisis. Personally I&amp;#39;d gladly earn a bit less and commute a bit more, (assuming you can get hired, that&amp;#39;s a whole other can of worms) if I&amp;#39;m offered the option to work at one of the very very few companies that kept to the law at the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: of course, if all companies respect that, then you should move unto other criteria; but I think the first and foremost question should be this one, and only when you are certain a companies is trustworthy, should other factors matter - to assume this is automatically true is a bit arrogant. &lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"So I'm someone who had studied 9 languages in my life, in school (university/HS), with private teachers and by myself, so I've come across books of both good and bad quality. Here is my experience so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Books from the '80s or '90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it's a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I've seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

Since so many of these books are ""trendy"" today (that is, used as official education material by schools), they actually worsen the quality of language studies for students of any kind. Worst of all, they charge actual money for these books and courses based on them, whereas better alternatives are widely available online, for free (without piracy, of course). My example is, again, Spanish. I'd learned Spanish in high school, and decided to start it again from scratch as it was 7 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending only one afternoon searching for materials online for self-study, I've found 2 websites, one of which is literally a very easy-to-understand, to-the-point encyclopedia with EVERYTHING related to Spanish grammar and words, and the other is a more structured learning site for the basics. I've also found no less than 5 YouTubers who are native Spanish teachers posting videos weekly, explaining all the nuances and points in Spanish grammar in a very easy-to-understand way with examples. So basically they provide more and more useful information in a (often) way more comprehensible manner than most of today's textbooks and courses (even some teachers), completely for free.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, being charged real-life money for books and (often, but not always) courses of sub-par quality, whereas within a few hours of searching (again, without illegal piracy), one can easily find MUCH better material for self-study, completely FREE.  


So, my opinion is that these books should either be regulated VERY strictly so that they actually have some use and contain quality material, or should be forced to be ""gettable"" for free, since they do not possess any inherent value considering the above-mentioned facts/alternatives. I'm sure the same applies to other (major) languages as well, not just to Spanish. What are your opinions?

,changemyview,"In 1947, conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India was so severe that there was no way to create a united India. Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.

Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn't. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.

With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent   
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. 

The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. 

With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.

Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.

Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn&amp;#39;t. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent&lt;br/&gt;
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades.

,changemyview,"Women are vulnerable to terrible, tragic acts of violence. While men represent the largest number of victims in contrast to women, it is also proven that men are the usual perpetrators of said violence. So, when seen through the lens of gender, it is often assumed that when a man commits an act of violence against a woman, it is not only gender related, but gender motivated, gender reasoned, gender intentioned. As the maxim dictates, it was committed specifically because they are female.

But violence is —as anything human— a very complex phenomenon. Why do men commit more violent crimes? Is it biological? Is it cultural? Where they not raised properly? Did their moms hate them? Do they have an inner desire to hurt the opposite sex, fueled by hours watching football games and going to Hooters? The motivations for an individual to commit violent acts are no simple matter, yet we pretend to know what is happening inside the mind of a criminal. That is an oversimplification that keeps us from learning about the criminal mind, about the violent mind, the human mind, about the hidden motivations that stir inside an individual that more than simply being a man, is a dissident member of civilization.

It is not my intention to argue that gender violence does not exist, it would be naïve from me to assume that women have not lived pain and suffering caused by other human beings strictly because they are women. But it is unacceptable to make the armchair assumption that when a woman’s rights are violated, it was strictly because of gender norms. Yes, gender is a factor that must be evaluated, as many other factors should be considered. But to assume that a person is motivated strictly because of it blinds us from understanding what is ticking inside a perpetrator, and understanding those motivations is paramount if we want to prevent other human beings —including ourselves— from following a path of horror.

Example: women are physically weaker and more vulnerable than men. An individual with the intent of causing physical harm  —which is a mystery, by itself, not easy to solve— to another could look for any vulnerable victim, targeting physically weaker individuals or socially and legally under protected minorities, since he or she could not be particularly interested in engaging in a physical challenge ([Richard Ramirez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), [Juana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Barraza), to name a few). In this scenario, the motivation for a crime could transcend gender. If a strong, mentally disturbed man assaults a weak, vulnerable woman and we assume it was a gender motivated crime, we could be asking the wrong questions.

The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on *machismo* and *the patriarchy*, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.

If that was case, we should’ve seen evidence of extraterrestrials colonizing the galaxy several times. We don’t see any evidence and this is where the Fermi paradox comes in. We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out. Surely, there had to have evolved at least one species of where their inherent nature wouldn’t have ultimately destroyed themselves. The rest of the solutions to the paradox I’ve heard are just things that would distract a species from colonizing the galaxy such as the civilization was trapped in a virtual world sort of like the movie Ready player one of you want to compare these two situations in any way. I’m also highly skeptical of those situations. The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies. I am open to some hypothetical situations like us being in a zoo or aliens trying to hide from us because we aren’t ready for extraterrestrial contact. I find these highly unlikely though, but I guess I have to remain open to some strange possibilities.

,changemyview,"Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don't believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I'm open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.

My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. 

From a religious perspective, I'm sure that I don't need to explain why you'd think there is an afterlife. I'm sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. 

My basic idea behind the possibility of an ""afterlife"" from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don't know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. 

Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. 

 You could make the argument that that isn't ""you"", that's a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that's a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of ""I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don't have a ""belief"" really either way, but it's not something I dismiss as easily as I've seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect. This idea is potentially supported by NDE's (anecdotal, I know) and the weird circumstances surrounding those. There's other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like ""How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?"" Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn't that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.

There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence. (Which I want to emphasize once again, I do consider to be a possibility. Just not the most likely one). 

I think reality is just strange and almost incoherent enough to suggest that if it happens once, it may continue to happen or happen again. 

Thank you all, I can't wait to read the replies.",t2_3ktrs6xg,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: I think nothing happening after death is unlikely,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,OPdelta,0,FALSE,t3_ge7p8m,FALSE,dark,0.52,,public,1,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},Delta(s) from OP,FALSE,1,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588746596,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don&amp;#39;t believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I&amp;#39;m open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a religious perspective, I&amp;#39;m sure that I don&amp;#39;t need to explain why you&amp;#39;d think there is an afterlife. I&amp;#39;m sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic idea behind the possibility of an &amp;quot;afterlife&amp;quot; from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don&amp;#39;t know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. &lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

,changemyview,"I posted a CMV many weeks back proposing that the best way to a limited amount of relief funds was to give it directly to people and let them decide the best way for them to survive with it. This will reward businesses who are supplying the most direct needs and allow them to survive and even thrive and employ more people. The original post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fnkhw2/cmv_the_majority_of_government_economic_disaster/). Since that time, the U.S. federal government has given us a natural experiment in that it disbursed the majority of relief funds in three ways:

1. Directly to every taxpayer,
2. Unemployment subsidy (a semi-direct that goes through the state unemployment office), and
3. ""Payroll Protection Plan"" (PPP) where funds are given to business owners for them to pay employees their previous wages.

Let's look at the effectiveness of each one, starting with the unemployment subsidy. This took the form of a $600 per week addition on top of what somebody who lost their job and qualified for unemployment would get. This was fairly successful for persons who lost their jobs--25 million in just three weeks--and allowed them to keep feeding their families and pay rent and mortgages. This can be considered somewhat of a direct payment but it comes with a set of problems due to the fact that it went through the unemployment office, which I will address soon.

The next one to look at is the PPP, which paid businesses to keep people employed. This plan's problems and rollouts are well known. If you don't know the issues, you can read about it [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/04/07/ppp-loan-plan-rollout-disaster-small-businesses/2963901001/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/848389343/how-did-the-small-business-loan-program-have-so-many-problems-in-just-4-weeks). In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn't worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.

Another issue is that many employees were getting more money *not* to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work. (""[Furloughed Workers Don’t Want To Return To Their Jobs As They’re Earning More Money With Unemployment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/04/28/furloughed-workers-dont-want-to-return-to-their-jobs-as-theyre-earning-more-money-with-unemployment/#3d176b896b76)"", Forbes Magazine, April 28, 2020)

By far the best use of funds was the direct-to-taxpayer payment. Businesses all across the country saw immediate spikes in revenue starting the week that people got these funds. This is what has allowed them to bring employees back to work.

In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn&amp;#39;t worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that many employees were getting more money &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work. (&amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/04/28/furloughed-workers-dont-want-to-return-to-their-jobs-as-theyre-earning-more-money-with-unemployment/#3d176b896b76""&gt;Furloughed Workers Don’t Want To Return To Their Jobs As They’re Earning More Money With Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, Forbes Magazine, April 28, 2020)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the best use of funds was the direct-to-taxpayer payment. Businesses all across the country saw immediate spikes in revenue starting the week that people got these funds. This is what has allowed them to bring employees back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, relief funds should be weighted heavily towards direct payments to people. The recent government relief efforts have proven this.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"For many reasons, reddit and other international platforms often focus on offered wage and other work-related elements. Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. 

When unemployment was at &gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. 

It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you'd see a clear rise in cases (and you'd be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.

To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.

When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you'll appreciate most.

,changemyview,"So I'm someone who had studied 9 languages in my life, in school (university/HS), with private teachers and by myself, so I've come across books of both good and bad quality. Here is my experience so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Books from the '80s or '90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it's a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I've seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

Since so many of these books are ""trendy"" today (that is, used as official education material by schools), they actually worsen the quality of language studies for students of any kind. Worst of all, they charge actual money for these books and courses based on them, whereas better alternatives are widely available online, for free (without piracy, of course). My example is, again, Spanish. I'd learned Spanish in high school, and decided to start it again from scratch as it was 7 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending only one afternoon searching for materials online for self-study, I've found 2 websites, one of which is literally a very easy-to-understand, to-the-point encyclopedia with EVERYTHING related to Spanish grammar and words, and the other is a more structured learning site for the basics. I've also found no less than 5 YouTubers who are native Spanish teachers posting videos weekly, explaining all the nuances and points in Spanish grammar in a very easy-to-understand way with examples. So basically they provide more and more useful information in a (often) way more comprehensible manner than most of today's textbooks and courses (even some teachers), completely for free.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, being charged real-life money for books and (often, but not always) courses of sub-par quality, whereas within a few hours of searching (again, without illegal piracy), one can easily find MUCH better material for self-study, completely FREE.  


So, my opinion is that these books should either be regulated VERY strictly so that they actually have some use and contain quality material, or should be forced to be ""gettable"" for free, since they do not possess any inherent value considering the above-mentioned facts/alternatives. I'm sure the same applies to other (major) languages as well, not just to Spanish. What are your opinions?

,changemyview,"In 1947, conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India was so severe that there was no way to create a united India. Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.

Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn't. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.

With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent   
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. 

The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. 

With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.

Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.

,changemyview,"Women are vulnerable to terrible, tragic acts of violence. While men represent the largest number of victims in contrast to women, it is also proven that men are the usual perpetrators of said violence. So, when seen through the lens of gender, it is often assumed that when a man commits an act of violence against a woman, it is not only gender related, but gender motivated, gender reasoned, gender intentioned. As the maxim dictates, it was committed specifically because they are female.

But violence is —as anything human— a very complex phenomenon. Why do men commit more violent crimes? Is it biological? Is it cultural? Where they not raised properly? Did their moms hate them? Do they have an inner desire to hurt the opposite sex, fueled by hours watching football games and going to Hooters? The motivations for an individual to commit violent acts are no simple matter, yet we pretend to know what is happening inside the mind of a criminal. That is an oversimplification that keeps us from learning about the criminal mind, about the violent mind, the human mind, about the hidden motivations that stir inside an individual that more than simply being a man, is a dissident member of civilization.

It is not my intention to argue that gender violence does not exist, it would be naïve from me to assume that women have not lived pain and suffering caused by other human beings strictly because they are women. But it is unacceptable to make the armchair assumption that when a woman’s rights are violated, it was strictly because of gender norms. Yes, gender is a factor that must be evaluated, as many other factors should be considered. But to assume that a person is motivated strictly because of it blinds us from understanding what is ticking inside a perpetrator, and understanding those motivations is paramount if we want to prevent other human beings —including ourselves— from following a path of horror.

Example: women are physically weaker and more vulnerable than men. An individual with the intent of causing physical harm  —which is a mystery, by itself, not easy to solve— to another could look for any vulnerable victim, targeting physically weaker individuals or socially and legally under protected minorities, since he or she could not be particularly interested in engaging in a physical challenge ([Richard Ramirez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), [Juana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Barraza), to name a few). In this scenario, the motivation for a crime could transcend gender. If a strong, mentally disturbed man assaults a weak, vulnerable woman and we assume it was a gender motivated crime, we could be asking the wrong questions.

The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on *machismo* and *the patriarchy*, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.

Japan, our close ally and 2nd largest holder of our debt, definitely won't.

There may be some alien microbes and a few plants and animal like life forms here and there. But I bet we are the only intelligent life forms. We are the only species in the universe that is capable of making a civilization.

Now I would like to explain why I believe this. There was a physicist named Enrico Fermi. I don’t remember where I read this, but I believe the highest estimated amount of advanced civilizations in the galaxy that Fermi calculated was up to 10000 civilizations. If that was case, we should’ve seen evidence of extraterrestrials colonizing the galaxy several times. We don’t see any evidence and this is where the Fermi paradox comes in. We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out. Surely, there had to have evolved at least one species of where their inherent nature wouldn’t have ultimately destroyed themselves. The rest of the solutions to the paradox I’ve heard are just things that would distract a species from colonizing the galaxy such as the civilization was trapped in a virtual world sort of like the movie Ready player one of you want to compare these two situations in any way. I’m also highly skeptical of those situations. The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies. I am open to some hypothetical situations like us being in a zoo or aliens trying to hide from us because we aren’t ready for extraterrestrial contact.

,changemyview,"Why would i ever excuse someone for their actions because of mental illness? Or a mental condition/disorder? 
If you attempt to excuse your behavior because you have depression, or BPD, or Autism or ADHD, all you are trying to do is shift the blame to your neurochemistry. But this chain of reasoning inevitably leads to the conclusion that NOBODY can be held accountable for ANYTHING because everybody's actions are subject to and determined by their physiological, neurological etc. makeup. 

In fact if u think about it long enough, you'll realize that everybody's actions are subject to external deterministic forces. You can always shift the blame if you're desperate enough

Note - I'm not saying that a person should be blamed for an action which their mental illness may cause them to accidentily commit. That may be excusable because it is an ACCIDENT.

If you attempt to excuse your behavior because you have depression, or BPD, or Autism or ADHD, all you are trying to do is shift the blame to your neurochemistry. But this chain of reasoning inevitably leads to the conclusion that NOBODY can be held accountable for ANYTHING because everybody&amp;#39;s actions are subject to and determined by their physiological, neurological etc. makeup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact if u think about it long enough, you&amp;#39;ll realize that everybody&amp;#39;s actions are subject to external deterministic forces. You can always shift the blame if you&amp;#39;re desperate enough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note - I&amp;#39;m not saying that a person should be blamed for an action which their mental illness may cause them to accidentily commit. That may be excusable because it is an ACCIDENT. But no willful action can be excused because of your mental illness or condition. Inention is what matters - you can excuse your accidents, but not your intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"Hello, I should probably get out of the way that I am in no way a religious person, which would seem to contradict the proposition of this post. I consider myself to be an agnostic atheist, which to me means I don't believe there is anything holy or supernatural, but I'm open to the possibility of it. I just generally consider myself to be skeptical of any belief system that proposes itself to be an ultimate truth, including both theology and physicalist naturalism.

My view is that regardless of your personal philosophical beliefs about reality, the idea that after death awaits eternal nothingness is incredibly unlikely. I think nothing after death is a real possibility, but the more I read about various topics the less likely it seems to me. 

From a religious perspective, I'm sure that I don't need to explain why you'd think there is an afterlife. I'm sure the people who will be most opposed to this idea are the naturalist atheist types, whose views I would definitely consider to be the closest to my own. 

My basic idea behind the possibility of an ""afterlife"" from a naturalist point of view would be one of scope more than anything else. Even if consciousness is purely a result of our physical brain (which is still up for debate) and when we die our consciousness ceases to exist, I think the chances of us not being born again as ourselves to be highly unlikely. We don't know for sure if the time and space of our universe is finite, and we are unsure whether or not we are the only universe in existence. Some think there may be an infinite number of universes that are created and destroyed all the time, floating around like bubbles in a much grander space. If we find the universe(s) to be infinite, there is a 100% chance we will be born again, and likely have been before. 

Some even believe that our universe is a cycle that expands, eventually condenses, and releases itself in another big bang. If this is assumed to happen an infinite number of times, you will inevitably be born again, exactly as you were in your previous life. 

 You could make the argument that that isn't ""you"", that's a twin of some sort born of probability, but I think that's a matter of interpretation more than anything else. I think the concept of ""I to be quite a strange one in that of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big one for me is the aforementioned unknown origin of consciousness, which I don't have a ""belief"" really either way, but it's not something I dismiss as easily as I've seen others do. I think the idea that there is some big (call it mystical or metaphysical if you will) property or concept of the universe that could have some sort of an influence over the matter that we observe and are composed of really is not that unreasonable of a prospect.

There's other things that make me wonder about consciousness, such as ideas like ""How is consciousness evolutionary beneficial?"" Every single thing we do that allows us to survive can be done without the self awareness that we experience, yet we experience consciousness which more often damages us than helps us. I think the idea of consciousness not originating in the brain or persisting after death in some way isn't that crazy of an idea, considering some of the other weird mainstream interpretations of theoretical physics and whatnot.

There are other possible interpretations that suggest that reality is much stranger than it seems to be, from the simulation theory to our minds creating the world around us to  parallel universes we transition between and 1,000 other wacky ass interpretations of reality, but I think in a very small number possibilities would suggest that our consciousness exists only in this one time existence. (Which I want to emphasize once again, I do consider to be a possibility. Just not the most likely one).

,changemyview,"In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models&amp;#39; &amp;quot;humanity&amp;quot; is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their &amp;quot;flesh&amp;quot; ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human &amp;quot;flesh&amp;quot; that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not &amp;quot;flesh&amp;quot;, this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"I posted a CMV many weeks back proposing that the best way to a limited amount of relief funds was to give it directly to people and let them decide the best way for them to survive with it. This will reward businesses who are supplying the most direct needs and allow them to survive and even thrive and employ more people. The original post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fnkhw2/cmv_the_majority_of_government_economic_disaster/). Since that time, the U.S. federal government has given us a natural experiment in that it disbursed the majority of relief funds in three ways:

1. Directly to every taxpayer,
2. Unemployment subsidy (a semi-direct that goes through the state unemployment office), and
3. ""Payroll Protection Plan"" (PPP) where funds are given to business owners for them to pay employees their previous wages.

Let's look at the effectiveness of each one, starting with the unemployment subsidy. This took the form of a $600 per week addition on top of what somebody who lost their job and qualified for unemployment would get. This was fairly successful for persons who lost their jobs--25 million in just three weeks--and allowed them to keep feeding their families and pay rent and mortgages. This can be considered somewhat of a direct payment but it comes with a set of problems due to the fact that it went through the unemployment office, which I will address soon.

The next one to look at is the PPP, which paid businesses to keep people employed. This plan's problems and rollouts are well known. If you don't know the issues, you can read about it [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/04/07/ppp-loan-plan-rollout-disaster-small-businesses/2963901001/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/848389343/how-did-the-small-business-loan-program-have-so-many-problems-in-just-4-weeks). In short, major corporations got a lot of money--45% of the funds went to just 4% of companies in the form of $1 million to $10 million forgiveable loans. The fund ran dry in weeks. Many small businesses were unable to get the funds. But those that did found that the demand did not really warrant bringing people back to work and paying them to do nothing. Restaurants who stayed open were already paying staff to work based upon the level of business they were getting. Some restaurants did things like have their employees clean the place top to bottom, but had little else for them to do. Other restaurants decided it wasn't worth trying to manage and pay employees without any tasks. Many businesses that tapped into the program also had no need for the funds. They had enough reserves and/or access to other forms of credit and capital.

Another issue is that many employees were getting more money *not* to work because of the unemployment insurance subsidy. They told their employers to not call them back to work.

By far the best use of funds was the direct-to-taxpayer payment. Businesses all across the country saw immediate spikes in revenue starting the week that people got these funds. This is what has allowed them to bring employees back to work.

,changemyview,"For many reasons, reddit and other international platforms often focus on offered wage and other work-related elements. Many, many, subreddits have slews of users who are young people from northern  Europe working in tech (i.e. some of the most privileged individuals). To me, however, and to many of my peers, this is a very entitled view of an employer, who assumes a lot of things. 

When unemployment was at &gt;50%, most employers would pay below minimum wage to new hires (few new jobs paid, at the time, at least minimum wage), refuse to pay (knowing lawsuits would be too expensive - this was an insanely common issue), expect people to work for free for up to one week before agreeing to hire them, etc. I would argue that an employer would stand out as a very good employer if they followed the law. The very, very few, private sector entities that did are still seen as worthy employers today. 

It is not so much the local labour laws that matter, but how much they are followed. If murders stayed illegal, but all consequences vanished, then you'd see a clear rise in cases (and you'd be unwilling to get along with an assassin, even if they suffered no ill-effect from what they did at the time). And since, in effect, labour law nearly collapsed, a company that decided to stick to the law, at a time when almost no one else did, makes it appear as incredibly trustworthy. In other words, if a company has the opportunity of behaving like manure, but they opt for the high-road, and are one of the very few to do  so, then to me and my peers this reflected on them as a trustworthy employer who will not sneakily exploit you at the first chance they get.

To  me  and those of my generation a reliable and trustworthy employer is paramount, and I know a few people who would rather work there because such reputations, than many other places.

When all goes to shit, the stable and trustworthy guy is the one you'll appreciate most. And to this day a company I can trust to pay, to pay what they say on paper, and to pay on time is highly, highly praised. All of those are still issues, and I'm sure will once again be at the forefront with the Covid-19   crisis. Personally I'd gladly earn a bit less and commute a bit more, (assuming you can get hired, that's a whole other can of worms) if I'm offered the option to work at one of the very very few companies that kept to the law at the times.

Note: of course, if all companies respect that, then you should move unto other criteria; but I think the first and foremost question should be this one, and only when you are certain a companies is trustworthy, should other factors matter - to assume this is automatically true is a bit arrogant. 

Note2: before someone says ""if you had skill and education then you wouldn't say this, just invest in yourself"" or ""if you weren't lazy and studied"": I have a Bachelor, will have an MS in a couple month and speak four languages fluently (plus my mother tongue).

,changemyview,"So I'm someone who had studied 9 languages in my life, in school (university/HS), with private teachers and by myself, so I've come across books of both good and bad quality. Here is my experience so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Books from the '80s or '90s are the best (in general, there are exceptions), as they really do describe the grammar and ruleset of the language they are trying to teach with the aim of teaching the student that language; whereas more modern books, say, post-2000s are so watered-down, it seems like their only goal is to keep the student in the education system (especially if it's a language school for which individuals pay money to be a part of) for as long as possible while only producing very low results. I've seen, for example, my Spanish book break the preterite indicative into 3 or 4 lessons spanning 30+ pages, whereas it can be explained within one A/4 page and the rest could have been be exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

Since so many of these books are ""trendy"" today (that is, used as official education material by schools), they actually worsen the quality of language studies for students of any kind. Worst of all, they charge actual money for these books and courses based on them, whereas better alternatives are widely available online, for free (without piracy, of course). My example is, again, Spanish. I'd learned Spanish in high school, and decided to start it again from scratch as it was 7 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending only one afternoon searching for materials online for self-study, I've found 2 websites, one of which is literally a very easy-to-understand, to-the-point encyclopedia with EVERYTHING related to Spanish grammar and words, and the other is a more structured learning site for the basics. I've also found no less than 5 YouTubers who are native Spanish teachers posting videos weekly, explaining all the nuances and points in Spanish grammar in a very easy-to-understand way with examples. So basically they provide more and more useful information in a (often) way more comprehensible manner than most of today's textbooks and courses (even some teachers), completely for free.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, being charged real-life money for books and (often, but not always) courses of sub-par quality, whereas within a few hours of searching (again, without illegal piracy), one can easily find MUCH better material for self-study, completely FREE.  


So, my opinion is that these books should either be regulated VERY strictly so that they actually have some use and contain quality material, or should be forced to be ""gettable"" for free, since they do not possess any inherent value considering the above-mentioned facts/alternatives. I'm sure the same applies to other (major) languages as well, not just to Spanish. What are your opinions?

,changemyview,"In 1947, conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India was so severe that there was no way to create a united India. Religious tensions had grown to a point where there could no longer be unity. Doing such would have led to a brutal religious war that would have killed millions. So the country was divided on religious lines into India and Pakistan by the British colonial authorities. While there have been a few violent border skirmishes since then (like in Jammu and Kashmir), the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent saved millions from wars that could have potentially happened. The partition was handled badly at the time (causing a lot of deaths among both religious groups, as well as displacements of groups like Sikhs), but  I believe there was no possible way to prevent this. Furthermore, the fact that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons has prevented the two states from going to war.

Similarly, political polarization in the United States has grown to a point where it is impossible to overcome. Most Republicans hate Democrats and most Democrats hate Republicans. News feeds have become more polarized than before, and most people only watch the news that confirms their political ideologies. Many people I know in my personal life have cut other people out of their lives over differences in political beliefs and ideologies. Most politicians in either party only listen to their base and never reach out to the other party. The political polarization in the United States has been reflected in Congress, where there has been deadlock for at least the past decade. Few sweeping reforms have been passed by either party because the US political system has prevented either side from making rapid changes to the status quo. Some people think of the United States as a coherent nation, but it really isn't. Few people understand how the other half lives, and most live lifestyles diametrically opposed to each other.

With the current increase in political polarization, I believe a second civil war becomes more imminent   
 of a threat each day. The days of compromise are behind us. That cat has been out of the bag for at least the past two decades. With most people hating their political opponents, I think that eventually the spark to war will happen. Some may argue that the US military would not attack its citizens during such a war, but this notion is false given as to the historical military response in the Haymarket Riots and the Kent State massacre. Whichever side of a conflict the US military is on will curb stomp the other side, causing massive amounts of political dissatisfaction among the losing side after the war is finished. With such a war over, the losing side would not be able to voice their opinions in government, and then political dissatisfaction would cause more instability that could last for decades. 

The most logical solution to this problem is to partition the United States into at least two (possibly more) ideologically homogeneous successor states. The boundaries for such a hypothetical Democratic nation(s) would likely include the west coast states and those in the Northeast (plus maybe some parts of the Upper Midwest. A hypothetical Republican nation (or nations) would include large areas of the Southeast, West, Great Plains, and some portions of the Upper Midwest. Both of these nations should keep a free trade agreement with each other to prevent economic ruin, and each nation should have a nuclear arsenal to keep the peace in North America. It could get messy during the partition due to political exclaves existing across the United States, but this problem could be solved by a population transfer between both nations, ensuring a continental harmony. If splitting the US into two nations creates too much turmoil, it might be more feasible to dissolve the US into several smaller sovereign states. 

With the United States divided into smaller nations, then there would be more chance for real change in either nation. The Republican based nation(s) could enact policies representing their views without causing harm to ideological minorities living within (due to the population transfer), such as lowering tax rates, banning abortion or gay marriage, or expanding gun rights. The predominantly left wing nations (well, left wing by American standards) could pass legislation promoting their interests without gridlock preventing change, such as implementing stronger environmental laws, establishing a universal healthcare system, and decriminalizing recreational drugs.

Some may argue that it would be easier to reduce political polarization by changing how the US electoral system works, via implementing systems such as mixed-member proportional voting for Congress and ranked alternative vote systems for the Presidency. However, attempting such a move would be a pipe dream. Changing the Constitution was intentionally made extremely difficult by the founders of the United States, and with the current gridlock in place, neither side wants the other to modify it. Both the Democratic and Republican parties seek to maintain their power, and their leadership would never let such constitutional edits to take place. It would be easier to carve up the United States into smaller nations, and then allow these nations to effectively remove polarization.

,changemyview,"Women are vulnerable to terrible, tragic acts of violence. While men represent the largest number of victims in contrast to women, it is also proven that men are the usual perpetrators of said violence. So, when seen through the lens of gender, it is often assumed that when a man commits an act of violence against a woman, it is not only gender related, but gender motivated, gender reasoned, gender intentioned. As the maxim dictates, it was committed specifically because they are female.

But violence is —as anything human— a very complex phenomenon. Why do men commit more violent crimes? Is it biological? Is it cultural? Where they not raised properly? Did their moms hate them? Do they have an inner desire to hurt the opposite sex, fueled by hours watching football games and going to Hooters? The motivations for an individual to commit violent acts are no simple matter, yet we pretend to know what is happening inside the mind of a criminal. That is an oversimplification that keeps us from learning about the criminal mind, about the violent mind, the human mind, about the hidden motivations that stir inside an individual that more than simply being a man, is a dissident member of civilization.

It is not my intention to argue that gender violence does not exist, it would be naïve from me to assume that women have not lived pain and suffering caused by other human beings strictly because they are women. But it is unacceptable to make the armchair assumption that when a woman’s rights are violated, it was strictly because of gender norms. Yes, gender is a factor that must be evaluated, as many other factors should be considered. But to assume that a person is motivated strictly because of it blinds us from understanding what is ticking inside a perpetrator, and understanding those motivations is paramount if we want to prevent other human beings —including ourselves— from following a path of horror.

Example: women are physically weaker and more vulnerable than men. An individual with the intent of causing physical harm  —which is a mystery, by itself, not easy to solve— to another could look for any vulnerable victim, targeting physically weaker individuals or socially and legally under protected minorities, since he or she could not be particularly interested in engaging in a physical challenge ([Richard Ramirez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ramirez), [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer), [Juana Barraza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Barraza), to name a few). In this scenario, the motivation for a crime could transcend gender. If a strong, mentally disturbed man assaults a weak, vulnerable woman and we assume it was a gender motivated crime, we could be asking the wrong questions.

The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on *machismo* and *the patriarchy*, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.

&lt;p&gt;The prejudice of blaming violent crimes on &lt;em&gt;machismo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;the patriarchy&lt;/em&gt;, claiming that the victim being a female was the sole motivation for its realization, is hindering our understanding of other psychological factors, an understanding that might prove to be more helpful in putting a stop to the atrocities perpetrated against men and women alike.&lt;/p&gt;

There may be some alien microbes and a few plants and animal like life forms here and there. But I bet we are the only intelligent life forms. We are the only species in the universe that is capable of making a civilization.

Now I would like to explain why I believe this. There was a physicist named Enrico Fermi. I don’t remember where I read this, but I believe the highest estimated amount of advanced civilizations in the galaxy that Fermi calculated was up to 10000 civilizations. If that was case, we should’ve seen evidence of extraterrestrials colonizing the galaxy several times. We don’t see any evidence and this is where the Fermi paradox comes in. We basically ask the question “Where is everybody?”. Some solutions to the paradox that I’ve heard is that interstellar travel is incredibly hard. Even if that’s true, we still should’ve seen evidence of colonization throughout the galaxy. Traditional propulsion alone should’ve only taken a civilization around 50 million years at most. Another solution I’ve heard is that civilizations die out before they colonize the galaxy. Quick question, would a civilization that colonized an entire galaxy be classified as a type 3 civilization on the Kardeshev scale? Anyways, I’m highly skeptical that every civilization died out. Surely, there had to have evolved at least one species of where their inherent nature wouldn’t have ultimately destroyed themselves. The rest of the solutions to the paradox I’ve heard are just things that would distract a species from colonizing the galaxy such as the civilization was trapped in a virtual world sort of like the movie Ready player one of you want to compare these two situations in any way. I’m also highly skeptical of those situations. The Fermi paradox is usually supposed to only deal with the galaxy, not the universe as a whole so if my objections are correct, I only proved that intelligent aliens don’t exist in the galaxy, not the universe as a whole. I guess my way of proving they don’t exist in the universe is that we should’ve seen a multitude of intelligent aliens leaving their galaxies at least some point in time and colonizing other galaxies. I am open to some hypothetical situations like us being in a zoo or aliens trying to hide from us because we aren’t ready for extraterrestrial contact. I find these highly unlikely though, but I guess I have to remain open to some strange possibilities.

&lt;p&gt;Then you see the really grotesque stuff you dont want to believe it but it&amp;#39;s there, like most women wanting to sleep with as many men as possible until they grow beyond 30 where they settle for someone who gives them comfort even though there is no attraction. The idea of shit testing, and the fact that a woman will marry, screw, hang out with even if she doesnt like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate that it all seems true but please change my view this is a depressing reality&lt;/p&gt;

Every time theres a video of a cop doing something **good** (or even just a picture of a police puppy in training or something) you'll still find people saying ""ACAB"" or asking who police killed now because apparently there's a belief that such videos are part of a coordinated ""copaganda"" conspiracy to cover up police misconduct elsewhere.

I think this issue is exacerbated by the media who will focus in on cases of police misconduct (or even just controversial issues where their actions where justified, like the shooting of Michael Brown) and for *years* after the fact and hype it up because they know very well that police controversies sell. 

To be perfectly honest, the lack of any coherent reason to hate police makes the more cynical side of me wonder if all these flawed justifications for hating police are really just motivated by cops having busted redditors speeding or smoking weed or whatever years ago and, knowing that's not a rational reason to hate all police, the whole anti-cop narrative was constructed to cover for it.

,changemyview,"Do I think fat people should be shamed for the extra weight they carry? No. Do I think they should be praised for carrying it proudly? No

By promoting body positivity we're telling people essentially that any body type is okay. And while I'm not saying we should all be athletic gods and goddesses, no one should be happy with or encouraged to be proud of their overweight.

Obese people die sooner and have worse health complications. By telling young, impressionable people that their bodies are perfect just the way they are, we are promoting children to develop bad eating and exercise habits because we lie and tell them that their body is beautiful.

Body neutrality is better because it should be okay to hate parts of your body and want to change them. As I said, fat people shouldn't be shamed because of their lack of health. But honestly, obesity is gross, unhealthy, and leads to things like a higher chance of heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cancer, etc. 

Body positivity doesn't promote a healthy person as a whole. While it may \*superficially \*help their mental health it doesn't benefit their physical health which is equally important.

Edit: sorry I came here to try and learn from a good argument. So many people are downvoting my comments. I honestly don't care do as you want. But I'm unsure if that's the best option when an opinion doesn't work with yours

Edit 2: if you're going to put down well people with [very specific condition] can't help but be fat that still isn't an argument for body positivity imo but you'll comment anyways so what do I care

Edit 3: this is becoming a lot for now. It's almost 3 a.m. where I'm at I'll check back in on this in the morning. Lots of people getting really fired up. I cane here for a good argument to help change my view not to be internet yelled at lol. But again, what the hell do I care what y'all do

Edit 4: Wow okay before you comment let me just put up some common misconceptions. I am not saying that we should tell fat people that they are gross straight up to their face. I'm saying as a society we shouldn't promote unhealthy body types. If you're here to say something off topic I'm really not interested in responding. By the kill themselves content in the title in referring to the onslaught of health conditions. I do not care about the time you bribe your leg and gained 20 pounds for 6 months. All I think is that as a society we should printer healthy lifestyle choices

Edit 5: I am open to changing my view and two arguments have struck some change in me. But I'm not fully convinced. I've mentioned in multiple comments that I understand my view is viewed as toxic by many but I dunt have anything compelling to change it

Edit 6: at this point in time people are commenting just to comment and it's getting really off topic. I'm not sure what my sexuality has to do with anything. I appreciate about 10 of you for having good arguments with me and specifically the two of you who gave well worded, non-attack mode arguments.

&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: Wow okay before you comment let me just put up some common misconceptions. I am not saying that we should tell fat people that they are gross straight up to their face. I&amp;#39;m saying as a society we shouldn&amp;#39;t promote unhealthy body types. If you&amp;#39;re here to say something off topic I&amp;#39;m really not interested in responding. By the kill themselves content in the title in referring to the onslaught of health conditions. I do not care about the time you bribe your leg and gained 20 pounds for 6 months. All I think is that as a society we should printer healthy lifestyle choices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 5: I am open to changing my view and two arguments have struck some change in me. But I&amp;#39;m not fully convinced. I&amp;#39;ve mentioned in multiple comments that I understand my view is viewed as toxic by many but I dunt have anything compelling to change it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 6: at this point in time people are commenting just to comment and it&amp;#39;s getting really off topic. I&amp;#39;m not sure what my sexuality has to do with anything. I appreciate about 10 of you for having good arguments with me and specifically the two of you who gave well worded, non-attack mode arguments. You earned those Delta&amp;#39;s for how they helped augment my view from where it was. The other 500+ of you didn&amp;#39;t really help much as you either didn&amp;#39;t read my post or edits and just started commenting with things I already addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"(I'm mostly talking about superhero comics because that is what I am most familiar with, but it also applies to non-superhero books as well.)

First off. I'll say that it's okay to not like a comic, or to not like it's story or characters or message/moral. That's an opinion and it's okay to have one. Simply saying politics should stay out of comics is not valid. I'm not saying every comic needs or even has a political message, some are just dumb fun.

However, throughout the publication history of comics there have been many cases in which the writer/creator injects topical and political elements into the stories. From the very creation of the superhero genre, politics has been part of the story. Superman, the first superhero, is an illegal alien created by two Jewish guys in the 1930s.

People only complain because they don't like the message. The same people complaining that Iceman is gay now are totally fine with the X-men as a whole. The X-men were an obvious allegory for race relations when they were created and now are compared with LGBT rights.

Essentially; politics are, always have been, and should continue to be a part or comics. Those who complain about it only disagree with the specific message.

Edit: While I still think these types of people exist, there are those that have honest critiques of how politics it written into comics. The [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/gfigrf/cmv_politics_has_always_been_a_part_of_comic/fpufcel/?context=8&amp;depth=9) that lead to the delta.",t2_j4b8qzp,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: Politics has always been a part of comic books and people wanting politics out of comic books simply don't like the message.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,OPdelta,0,FALSE,t3_gfigrf,FALSE,dark,0.71,,public,11,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},Delta(s) from OP,FALSE,11,,FALSE,,1588924980,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588925411,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m mostly talking about superhero comics because that is what I am most familiar with, but it also applies to non-superhero books as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off. I&amp;#39;ll say that it&amp;#39;s okay to not like a comic, or to not like it&amp;#39;s story or characters or message/moral. That&amp;#39;s an opinion and it&amp;#39;s okay to have one. Simply saying politics should stay out of comics is not valid. I&amp;#39;m not saying every comic needs or even has a political message, some are just dumb fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, throughout the publication history of comics there have been many cases in which the writer/creator injects topical and political elements into the stories. From the very creation of the superhero genre, politics has been part of the story. Superman, the first superhero, is an illegal alien created by two Jewish guys in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People only complain because they don&amp;#39;t like the message. The same people complaining that Iceman is gay now are totally fine with the X-men as a whole. The X-men were an obvious allegory for race relations when they were created and now are compared with LGBT rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially; politics are, always have been, and should continue to be a part or comics. Those who complain about it only disagree with the specific message.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele's weight loss *rolls eyes*
It's been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it's because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. 

But let's be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I'll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It's not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? 

Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let's face it. Losing weight sucks and it's really really hard. It's so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that's why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I've seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.

Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I'm trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It's not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. 

And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn't have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as. So if you truly see yourself for how and always as being overweight and you know why the love yourself and good things will come into your life.",t2_5kxee6kc,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: fat shaming isnt about body positivity and the fallout on social media of adele losing weight is a good example of that.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfiffa,FALSE,dark,0.65,,public,9,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,9,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588925275,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele&amp;#39;s weight loss &lt;em&gt;rolls eyes&lt;/em&gt;

It started in elementary school, and continued into high school. 20 years after I left high school I still have these feelings. I am also an asthmatic and these feeling are honestly damaging my personal development as an individual, even my health.

I was the classic nerd you have seen in the movies that was always the last to be picked on when I had physical education in school and we had to play multiple sports. In time I ""learned"" that I was inherently bad at sports but good with computers and somehow it seems I bought the idea that in order to be good in one thing you had to be bad in another. I remember PE class was terrible because even those who were my friends in class, dreaded to play in my team and often yelled at me during matches. In high school it got far worse, I was picked on not only by my classmates but even by my professor. I hated that guy's guts. We had to go on Wednesdays at 7AM to an open field that was right next to the ocean, in winter, only for him to give us a ball and tell us to play football (soccer). Of course everyone knew how to play but I didn't, they never taught us a single rule because apparently most Argentinians have this programmed into their DNA but it seems I did not. I was repeatedly humiliated by this 'professor', once he made me stood 15 minutes that seemed an eternity until I was able to get the ball on the other side of the net during volleyball class, while everyone laughed at me. 

When I went to college I was kind of surprised because I started meeting new, good people who loved the same things I did, but apparently many of them were fit and loved going to the gym or practicing sports like running or surfing. It seemed the stereotype, the personality pack that I had bought for so many years, wasn't real after all.

I have never been obese, i was a little overweight during short periods, but I have never been fit in my entire life. I think that if I could actually become fit and someday feel proud of my body I would just fall apart crying right in front of my mirror. I have done a little running and a little swimming in the past because I don't have that terrible memories about those activities, but \*every single time\* I do it I feel terrible. Like my inner voice tells me ""what the hell are you doing, don't you know this is not your thing, you're doing awful, this is absolutely pointless, you're not getting anywhere"". It doesn't help that I have never been able to appreciate positive physical changes in my body after exercising, probably because I have never done it more than two or three months in a row. My lifetime running record was 12km. I still remember how uncomfortable and out-of-place I felt each time I participated in 5km runs organized by my city. It honestly enrages me to hear people talking about how happy practicing sports will make you, as if all humans beings were made the same. I feel miserable each time I've done it, and the only reason I did it was because my hatred towards my body appearance was even stronger.

I know that sometimes people who post here don't really want to change their views but I'm not one of them. I realize how crippling this is in terms of my well being, but I can't flip a switch in my mind and start loving it.

Ok so I am very much hoping that someone on here can really change my view because I do feel awful saying this, but it’s been something on my mind. So here’s where I’m at:

I go to one of the top universities in the US, and our undergraduate program is heavily dominated by pre-med folk. Because it’s an elite university, there are a good chunk of students from wealthy families here. While my school was not specifically indicted by the whole college admissions scandal a year ago, I can’t help but see some of the privileges wealth can buy in getting ahead in competitive programs, and wonder whether there are some more insidious ways people are helping their children (aside from lying that their kids are on sports teams lol). 

Two of my good friends at this school are pre-med and have extra time accommodations on exams due to test anxiety. Both come from wealthy East Coast families and both are VERY smart (I don’t think they would be at this school if they weren’t!). I am not pre-med so I don’t take the classes a huge portion of the undergraduate population does, but I obviously know and speak with a lot of pre-meds, and word always spreads like wildfire after chemistry tests, and the general consensus is always that they are insanely hard because everything is too rushed and many people don’t finish on time. My two friends, however, have never complained to me of this. At the beginning of the year, before I found out about their accommodations (I only found out because they were in the same class as me second semester and were not present in the exam room with me, so I asked where they were and they explained), I was just really in awe of how they could fly through an exam and get impeccable grades on them. Then after I learned about the accommodations, I found myself thinking “Oh, that explains it”.

My friends don’t seem like very anxious people, but I don’t want to speak too much on that, as I have an general anxiety diagnosis as well and I am fully aware that the face you present to the world does not necessarily correlate with your personal struggles. My issue is that both of my friends are pre-med. Both want to be surgeons. If they cannot complete a chemistry exam within the time given due to the undue stress it puts them under, how are they going to handle surgery, when someone’s very life is at risk? You can’t ask for extra time on that. 

I don’t think that accommodations based on test anxiety should never be allowed. I recognize that there are lots of jobs like engineers, computer scientists, businesspeople, etc. who do not perform their jobs under the same stressful conditions as a timed examination, and can simply work on whatever project they’ve been given at a slower pace, or whatever it may be. My issue is that some professions do not afford this, and so students should not be able to get these accommodations if they are studying to enter one of these professions. The jobs that comes to mind is surgeon/doctor, and a courtroom lawyer. If you cannot operate under stressful conditions, I don’t think you could do these jobs. 

It is because of my own anxiety that I am not pursuing a career in either of these fields, because I understand I am not cut out for these fields. I do not respond well to stress at all, and I know these demanding jobs would be a detriment both to me mentally and to whoever I was trying to help. This is fine, as there are a myriad of other jobs I can have. 

I guess it comes down to the fact that I, as an anxiety sufferer, cannot imagine that someone who gets so anxious while taking a written exam (that one can argue at the end of the day means very little) that they have to have extra time (one has double the time) to do it could even consider a profession where you have to make snap decisions about someone’s life. My friends do better on exams by virtue of the fact that they are no longer rushed and have time to complete and fully think through all the questions, so a part of me wonders whether the accommodation is just another way of keeping GPAs high for medical school. 

To me it feels like a blind person trying to become a surgeon, both have limitations that mean they are not suited for the job at hand. That’s totally okay, they can receive accommodations necessary to perform other jobs. I think that a student should be able to have accommodations for test anxiety or they should be able to pursue a high-stress career, but not both.

I believe that divorce laws in various parts of the world have a very outdated conception of the social role of women. She is seen as unable to generate for the family, since decades ago either women did not work, or the salary was much lower than that of a man, making it impossible to be able to live without depending on a husband. Many divorces favor women more. But times have changed.

And I will be referring to marriages between men and women here, but the logic would also fit into same-sex marriages.

Today, some families have women as their main provider, and there is no equal wage difference like the old times. A working woman is no longer frowned upon. There is no reason why unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement, the division of assets is divided equally, or there are more benefits in divorce for women. I believe that during a divorce, the amount of assets that each will have must equal the financial contribution of each one during the marriage and that should be the only factor to be taken into account.

Yes, I believe that housewives do not deserve to finish anything bought by the husband from a divorce. Psychological support is no longer a valid argument for anyone who is sustained in a society in which everyone can work. It is not just because she will end up with nothing that she deserves something she didn’t work to achieve.

Honestly, I have never heard of a divorce in which the woman ended up at a disadvantage that did not involve a well-written nuptial agreement that protected the man.

And children's pensions should also be reviewed. I believe that there should be a better control of the one who gives the money on the end that it will be destined. All money from these pensions should go to children.

I believe that women and feminism fought hard to reach the equality we enjoy in many parts of the world, and I believe that the way in which divorce is carried out has a vestige of an idea that women should be protected. The advantages we have during divorce must be eradicated to reflect our era.

,changemyview,"**Nihilism**

&gt;**Nihilism** is the point of view that suspends belief in any or all general aspects of human life, which are culturally accepted. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nihilism is useful as a starting point for an intellectual exercise to better understand a cultural concept. It is not, however, a sustainable philosophy to build a society around.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to form a functioning society, there must be an overarching culture that binds people together. This culture must be built from some axioms that can be used to orient that culture's direction of development over time. For example, western liberalism (most of western civilization) is built from the axioms that human life has intrinsic value and the individual is sacred. These are concepts that emerged from the enlightenment and were derived from Judaeo-Christian tradition. It is useful to take a nihilistic approach when analyzing these axioms, to instead question why these assertions are true rather than assuming they are true, but nihilism cannot provide the necessary foundation on which to form a society because it questions the very concept of an axiom. It is not a starting point from which a society can build a culture and orient its development.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hedonism**

&gt;**Hedonism** is a school of thought that argues seeking pleasure and avoiding suffering are the only components of well-being. Ethical hedonism is the view that combines hedonism with welfarist ethics, which claim that what we should do depends exclusively on what affects the well-being individuals have. Ethical hedonists would defend either increasing pleasure and reducing suffering for all beings capable of experiencing them, or just reducing suffering in the case of negative consequentialism. According to negative utilitarianism, only the minimization of suffering would matter. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedonism is unhealthy for a society two ways. The first being directly through the adoption of its tenants into culture, and the second being indirectly through the adoption of its tenants by individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

Directly adopting tenants of  hedonism into a culture poses one large problem: *There is no objective means by which to measure pleasure and suffering.* Firstly this is a logistical issue, if your goal is to reduce suffering, whose suffering takes priority and how is that determination made. You cannot reduce everyone's suffering simultaneously and equally. Secondly, this will inevitably cause conflict. What reduces one person's suffering might increase the suffering of another. What might be pleasurable for one could be suffering for another.

&amp;#x200B;

Individuals adopting hedonism as a personal philosophy also creates problems. In addition to the conflicts mentioned above, on a psychological level, some suffering is required to give life meaning. In he process of overcoming adversity in an attempt to achieve a higher goal, encountering adversity will always lead to some form of suffering. We are aware of this, and subconsciously we crave this adversity, we are always the hero in our own story, when there is no dragon to battle against we create our own to justify ourselves, most recently becoming evident in the concept of *first-world problems*. This idea I feel was best illustrated in Fyodor Dostoyevski's *Notes from the Underground:*

&gt;Even if man were nothing but a piano key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of sheer ingratitude, simply to have his own way…then, after all, perhaps only by his curse will he attain his object, that is, really convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key!

Here goes: I believe that the common issues with our society, for example: climate change, wealth inequality, corruption and racism, stem from the idea that human nature ultimately creates a hierarchical structure in society.

Sites such as Facebook or Twitter are especially good at being a nesting ground for antivaxx, 5g lunatics, big pharma, etc. They keep on spreading their unfounded beliefs to their loyal fanbase. This is where the block user functionality sucks.

See, whenever a party wants to contrast their belief, they are immediately blocked. There is no way of pushing contrasting beliefs into a discussion, as you will just get blocked. This breeds echo-chambers, which are destructive, and lead to only more of conspiracies and idiocracy. Taking into consideration this, the block user function has a negative effect.However, I acknowledge that the function has been designed to help prevent doxxing, as well as insults, stalking and other harmful acts. Although the efficiency of blocking users in preventing insulting messages is not something that is entirely efficient, I can agree to assume that the block user function plays some role in preventing these acts. I also acknowledge that this was the reason it was designed. However, people abuse the power they have. Hence, I think that the function should be changed because it is used in a way that creates destructive communities and breeds echo-chambers.

Here is how I envision the change, however, this is obviously a matter that should be analyzed and considered by many, not a sole redditor. A person should have to choose the reason they are blocking someone. After they click ""block user"", there should be a prompt that asks for reason, such as for instance: ""the user is insulting"", ""the user is harassing"", ""doxxing"", ""spam"", etc. similarly to how a report function works. The user would then be blocked immediately, however, the claim would then be checked by a human supervisor, similarly to how it works with reports. Of course, all of these are matter to discussion. The reason it (In my opinion) should work this way is that there already exists the option to Mute a person on Twitter and Facebook, therefore, if a person does not want to see the comments, they can just mute the person. Nowadays, many users use ""block"" function instead of ""mute"", which means that they basically prevent their point from being contrasted by others (effectively breeding echo chambers).

Edit: I think I need to clarify that this post is about blocking, not muting.

\- Capitalism is built on and exploits the working class and encourages class struggle and inequality

\-The bourgeois exploits the proletariat for gaining more capital, while the working class must sell themselves (in some way, whether it's time, health, their safety, etc.) to survive

\-Capitalism is unstable and unsustainable, and the working class will revolt, moving a society from capitalism to socialism and eventually to communism (note: you can disagree with implementing communism in governments, but it's hard to deny that this cycle often happens, where the working class stands up for themselves and wants to slowly transition into a communist practice -- it's happening now in America).

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way.

I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media.

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

The most succinct way to describe my view is as the cornell link describes the ""collectives rights theory"":  

&gt;On the other hand, some scholars point to the prefatory language ""a well regulated Militia"" to argue that the Framers intended only to restrict Congress from legislating away a state's right to self-defense. Scholars have come to call this theory ""the collective rights theory."" 

Also, the full text of the second amendment in case people are too lazy to google:

&gt; A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 

So let's elaborate on my point of view. Why do I subscribe to the collectives rights theory (CRT) instead of the individual rights theory (IRT)? I'm neither for or against guns per se, as in I hold no political opinion on gun control (so you'll have a rather hard time arguing with me on a political basis because I really don't care). Rather, I look at the text and think that grammatically, the most correct way to interpret the literal text is to say that the people only have the rights to keep and bear arms for the purposes of being part of a well regulated militia, whose purpose is to ensure a free state (whether that be local, state, or federal).

Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a 'Glow up'. I think this kind of attitude is just thinly veiled bitterness and jealousy that someone has acheived something fantastic that they are happy with and proud of.

Adele was always a great singer and performer and arguably pretty too but she looks amazing now and very happy and if people are congratulating her I think it's wonderful. The mental gymnastics of people that are suggesting she might have depression, a drug addiction or even cancer is just a pathetic attempt at finding excuses for why she was able to do something that others can't. And it's all false too because she has been very open for YEARS about wanting to lose weight for various reasons. She cut out sugar in her tea (true brit), hired a trainer and a nutritionist etc, she worked really really hard and its just sad people that can't be happy for her.

This kind of tweet and retweet is what I mean:  [https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454](https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454)

The first guy saying some stupid shit about her looking like a sorority girl about to marry into old money doesn't even make fucking sense, but the retweet is just as bad saying that people like fat people getting thin (and healthier) too much. The woman retweeting is extremely fat and openly trying to use that to make herself a model so she has a vested interest in being obese not being seen as the negative thing that it is.

I also think it is disingenous to suggest this isn't a 'glow up'. What is the actual definition? From what I've seen it's literally just pictures of people age 15-18 or something then them in their 20s all done up with makeup. The whole idea of a 'glow up' is already vapid and shallow and suggesting Adele's doesn't count when it looks more like it than most others just shows the disingenuous nature of these people's attitude.

&lt;p&gt;Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a &amp;#39;Glow up&amp;#39;.

,changemyview,"[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/) by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health. There are sometimes seem as a newer drug epidemic set to spar off with the opioid epidemic for it's debilitating effects on public health. 

Benzodiazapines are a class of minor tranquilizer/sedative drugs that are less potent than their older, less safe equivalent barbiturates. They act positive allostatic modulators of the GABA-subtype A receptor and it's various subtypes of binding cites. By pulling in an influx of negatively charged chloride ions, they inhibit the firing of a neuron, thereby decreasing brain activity globally. Alcohol works as a GABA agonist as well, and also antagonizes the common excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, from which GABA is synthesized. 

GABA says ""stop"", glutamate says ""go"". This will be an important dichotomy to bear in mind. Currently, benzodiazapines like Vallium (diazapam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Atavian (lorazepam) are classified under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as Schedule IV class drugs. By being a controlled substance, a drug's availability becomes subject to extra legislation that non-scheduled drugs are not. For instance, refills on classes III-V expire after six months from the time they are written, which is normally a year for unscheduled drugs. Schedule II drugs require a new prescription every refill, and cannot have automatic refills attached to them. Meaning your doctor must write a new one each month. Also in the case of Schedule II, no more than a 30 day supple of the drug can be prescribed on one prescription. Which means if you take it once a day, you get 30 max. Penalties for illegal possession are also higher.  

So, my case is that benzodiazapines, as well as the non-benzodiazapine hypnotic ""Z-drugs"" such as Ambien and Lunesta, should be reclassified from Schedule IV to Schedule II. My argument for this is that benzodiazapines are addictive, highly abusable, and deadly. Withdrawal can last months, if not years. Longer than opioid withdrawal by a country mile. Abuse and chronic use of Benzodiazapines can cause tolerance to build, resulting in the uncoupling and down-regulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation or increased genetic expression of NMDA receptors, the brain's main glutamate receptor. This creates excito-toxicity in the brain that can cause apoptosis (neuron cell death, often permanent in most areas of the brain), long term structural and functional disturbances, and most famous of all, seizures! None of that is pleasant. 

Now you might be thinking ""Well hang on, by adding extra regulations, couldn't that get many people taken off their medication?"" 

Yes, it might. But the few conditions benzodiazapines are FDA approved to treat (insomnia, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and epilepsy) are finding new and alternative treatments. Anxiety disorders have antidepressants, BuSpar, or just plain old exercise. Insomnia has antihistamines (including prescription ones), exercise, and improvements in sleep hygiene. The only disorders I stand by giving benzodiazapines to as a first line treatment is for panic disorder and epilepsy. Those conditions benefit far more from chronic treatment than does anxiety and sleep disorders, both of which have plenty of alternative treatment options. 

The dangers and risks of benzodiazapines are pretty apparent, so I advise you not disregard those factors when trying to change my view. Also, as I see a lot in drug-related debates, deflecting to another drug or issue is not a valid argument in my eyes. Yes, opioids are currently more deadly. That does not reduce the harms benzodiazapines are causing.",t2_168wyr,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: Benzodiazapines should be rescheduled under the Controlled Substances Act from Schedule IV to Schedule II,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfktfh,FALSE,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,0,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588934418,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/""&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health.

,changemyview,"I will start by saying that I am not religious, and that this is a religious topic (didn't want to put the ""fired up"" religious wording in the title, in an effort to keep this discussion civil).

I am specifically referring to the fact that Jewish people are not allowed to do anything that can be considered ""work"" outside their home on a Saturday. This includes carrying objects. In order to get around this, in Manhattan, there is a wire strung around a whole bunch of light poles up off the ground enclosing a large portion of the island, such that people can say ""I am within the wire, so I am *teeeechnically* indoors, so I can carry stuff.""

I don't understand the point in imposing upon yourself this rule (and I do think it's imposed upon yourself rather than imposed upon you by your religion - you can choose not to be Jewish, or choose to ignore parts of the religion you don't agree with. Nobody is holding you at gunpoint), if you're going to break it. I can understand someone wanting to have the rule if that's what they want. I can also understand someone wanting to not have the rule. But I don't understand what the benefit is in saying ""I am going to follow the rule, but when I don't want to follow the rule, I'm going to stretch definitions such that I am now allowed to break the rule without actually breaking it"". Again, I'm not religious, but I don't think you're supposed to circumvent God like this by finding your own way to make yourself compliant. Presumably God has the ability to interpret things and would be able to say ""Oh, come on now, that doesn't count"".

I'm getting a bit into the weeds, but my point is that I don't see the purpose in trying to circumvent your own rule. It seems silly. CMV.

,changemyview,"Do I think fat people should be shamed for the extra weight they carry? No. Do I think they should be praised for carrying it proudly? No

By promoting body positivity we're telling people essentially that any body type is okay. And while I'm not saying we should all be athletic gods and goddesses, no one should be happy with or encouraged to be proud of their overweight.

Obese people die sooner and have worse health complications. By telling young, impressionable people that their bodies are perfect just the way they are, we are promoting children to develop bad eating and exercise habits because we lie and tell them that their body is beautiful.

Body neutrality is better because it should be okay to hate parts of your body and want to change them. As I said, fat people shouldn't be shamed because of their lack of health. But honestly, obesity is gross, unhealthy, and leads to things like a higher chance of heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cancer, etc. 

Body positivity doesn't promote a healthy person as a whole. While it may \*superficially \*help their mental health it doesn't benefit their physical health which is equally important.

Edit: sorry I came here to try and learn from a good argument. So many people are downvoting my comments. I honestly don't care do as you want. But I'm unsure if that's the best option when an opinion doesn't work with yours

Edit 2: if you're going to put down well people with [very specific condition] can't help but be fat that still isn't an argument for body positivity imo but you'll comment anyways so what do I care

Edit 3: this is becoming a lot for now. It's almost 3 a.m. where I'm at I'll check back in on this in the morning. Lots of people getting really fired up. I cane here for a good argument to help change my view not to be internet yelled at lol. But again, what the hell do I care what y'all do

Edit 4: Wow okay before you comment let me just put up some common misconceptions. I am not saying that we should tell fat people that they are gross straight up to their face. I'm saying as a society we shouldn't promote unhealthy body types. If you're here to say something off topic I'm really not interested in responding. By the kill themselves content in the title in referring to the onslaught of health conditions. I do not care about the time you bribe your leg and gained 20 pounds for 6 months. All I think is that as a society we should printer healthy lifestyle choices

Edit 5: I am open to changing my view and two arguments have struck some change in me. But I'm not fully convinced. I've mentioned in multiple comments that I understand my view is viewed as toxic by many but I dunt have anything compelling to change it

It's summer, they're blowing grass clippings and it's egregiously loud. There's no need to blow grass clippings. If you do feel there is a need to clean up grass clippings then buy mowers that bag the grass.

First off. I'll say that it's okay to not like a comic, or to not like it's story or characters or message/moral. That's an opinion and it's okay to have one. Simply saying politics should stay out of comics is not valid. I'm not saying every comic needs or even has a political message, some are just dumb fun.

However, throughout the publication history of comics there have been many cases in which the writer/creator injects topical and political elements into the stories. From the very creation of the superhero genre, politics has been part of the story. Superman, the first superhero, is an illegal alien created by two Jewish guys in the 1930s.

People only complain because they don't like the message. The same people complaining that Iceman is gay now are totally fine with the X-men as a whole. The X-men were an obvious allegory for race relations when they were created and now are compared with LGBT rights.

Essentially; politics are, always have been, and should continue to be a part or comics. Those who complain about it only disagree with the specific message.

,changemyview,"This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele's weight loss *rolls eyes*
It's been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it's because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. 

But let's be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I'll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It's not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? 

Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let's face it. Losing weight sucks and it's really really hard. It's so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that's why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I've seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.

Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I'm trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It's not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. 

And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn't have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as. So if you truly see yourself for how and always as being overweight and you know why the love yourself and good things will come into your life.",t2_5kxee6kc,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: fat shaming isnt about body positivity and the fallout on social media of adele losing weight is a good example of that.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfiffa,FALSE,dark,0.63,,public,7,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,7,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588925275,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele&amp;#39;s weight loss &lt;em&gt;rolls eyes&lt;/em&gt;

,changemyview,"I'm a 37 years old male living in Argentina who has develop a strange anger and/or resent towards sports that I cannot overcome. It started in elementary school, and continued into high school. 20 years after I left high school I still have these feelings. I am also an asthmatic and these feeling are honestly damaging my personal development as an individual, even my health.

I was the classic nerd you have seen in the movies that was always the last to be picked on when I had physical education in school and we had to play multiple sports. In time I ""learned"" that I was inherently bad at sports but good with computers and somehow it seems I bought the idea that in order to be good in one thing you had to be bad in another. I remember PE class was terrible because even those who were my friends in class, dreaded to play in my team and often yelled at me during matches. In high school it got far worse, I was picked on not only by my classmates but even by my professor. I hated that guy's guts. We had to go on Wednesdays at 7AM to an open field that was right next to the ocean, in winter, only for him to give us a ball and tell us to play football (soccer). Of course everyone knew how to play but I didn't, they never taught us a single rule because apparently most Argentinians have this programmed into their DNA but it seems I did not. I was repeatedly humiliated by this 'professor', once he made me stood 15 minutes that seemed an eternity until I was able to get the ball on the other side of the net during volleyball class, while everyone laughed at me. 

When I went to college I was kind of surprised because I started meeting new, good people who loved the same things I did, but apparently many of them were fit and loved going to the gym or practicing sports like running or surfing. It seemed the stereotype, the personality pack that I had bought for so many years, wasn't real after all.

I have never been obese, i was a little overweight during short periods, but I have never been fit in my entire life. I think that if I could actually become fit and someday feel proud of my body I would just fall apart crying right in front of my mirror. I have done a little running and a little swimming in the past because I don't have that terrible memories about those activities, but \*every single time\* I do it I feel terrible. Like my inner voice tells me ""what the hell are you doing, don't you know this is not your thing, you're doing awful, this is absolutely pointless, you're not getting anywhere"". It doesn't help that I have never been able to appreciate positive physical changes in my body after exercising, probably because I have never done it more than two or three months in a row. My lifetime running record was 12km. I still remember how uncomfortable and out-of-place I felt each time I participated in 5km runs organized by my city. It honestly enrages me to hear people talking about how happy practicing sports will make you, as if all humans beings were made the same. I feel miserable each time I've done it, and the only reason I did it was because my hatred towards my body appearance was even stronger.

I know that sometimes people who post here don't really want to change their views but I'm not one of them. I realize how crippling this is in terms of my well being, but I can't flip a switch in my mind and start loving it. To be honest I cannot guarantee that your answers will make me change my view but I hope that hearing multiple opinions about it will eventually wear out this mental blocker that I've formed during so many years.",t2_3em71fy4,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: I hate sports and exercising,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfjzy1,FALSE,dark,0.69,,public,6,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,6,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588931180,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 37 years old male living in Argentina who has develop a strange anger and/or resent towards sports that I cannot overcome.

I remember PE class was terrible because even those who were my friends in class, dreaded to play in my team and often yelled at me during matches. In high school it got far worse, I was picked on not only by my classmates but even by my professor. I hated that guy&amp;#39;s guts. We had to go on Wednesdays at 7AM to an open field that was right next to the ocean, in winter, only for him to give us a ball and tell us to play football (soccer). Of course everyone knew how to play but I didn&amp;#39;t, they never taught us a single rule because apparently most Argentinians have this programmed into their DNA but it seems I did not. I was repeatedly humiliated by this &amp;#39;professor&amp;#39;, once he made me stood 15 minutes that seemed an eternity until I was able to get the ball on the other side of the net during volleyball class, while everyone laughed at me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to college I was kind of surprised because I started meeting new, good people who loved the same things I did, but apparently many of them were fit and loved going to the gym or practicing sports like running or surfing. It seemed the stereotype, the personality pack that I had bought for so many years, wasn&amp;#39;t real after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never been obese, i was a little overweight during short periods, but I have never been fit in my entire life. I think that if I could actually become fit and someday feel proud of my body I would just fall apart crying right in front of my mirror. I have done a little running and a little swimming in the past because I don&amp;#39;t have that terrible memories about those activities, but *every single time* I do it I feel terrible. Like my inner voice tells me &amp;quot;what the hell are you doing, don&amp;#39;t you know this is not your thing, you&amp;#39;re doing awful, this is absolutely pointless, you&amp;#39;re not getting anywhere&amp;quot;. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that I have never been able to appreciate positive physical changes in my body after exercising, probably because I have never done it more than two or three months in a row. My lifetime running record was 12km. I still remember how uncomfortable and out-of-place I felt each time I participated in 5km runs organized by my city. It honestly enrages me to hear people talking about how happy practicing sports will make you, as if all humans beings were made the same. I feel miserable each time I&amp;#39;ve done it, and the only reason I did it was because my hatred towards my body appearance was even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that sometimes people who post here don&amp;#39;t really want to change their views but I&amp;#39;m not one of them. I realize how crippling this is in terms of my well being, but I can&amp;#39;t flip a switch in my mind and start loving it. To be honest I cannot guarantee that your answers will make me change my view but I hope that hearing multiple opinions about it will eventually wear out this mental blocker that I&amp;#39;ve formed during so many years.&lt;/p&gt;

Ok so I am very much hoping that someone on here can really change my view because I do feel awful saying this, but it’s been something on my mind. So here’s where I’m at:

I go to one of the top universities in the US, and our undergraduate program is heavily dominated by pre-med folk. Because it’s an elite university, there are a good chunk of students from wealthy families here. While my school was not specifically indicted by the whole college admissions scandal a year ago, I can’t help but see some of the privileges wealth can buy in getting ahead in competitive programs, and wonder whether there are some more insidious ways people are helping their children (aside from lying that their kids are on sports teams lol). 

Two of my good friends at this school are pre-med and have extra time accommodations on exams due to test anxiety. Both come from wealthy East Coast families and both are VERY smart (I don’t think they would be at this school if they weren’t!). I am not pre-med so I don’t take the classes a huge portion of the undergraduate population does, but I obviously know and speak with a lot of pre-meds, and word always spreads like wildfire after chemistry tests, and the general consensus is always that they are insanely hard because everything is too rushed and many people don’t finish on time. My two friends, however, have never complained to me of this. At the beginning of the year, before I found out about their accommodations (I only found out because they were in the same class as me second semester and were not present in the exam room with me, so I asked where they were and they explained), I was just really in awe of how they could fly through an exam and get impeccable grades on them. Then after I learned about the accommodations, I found myself thinking “Oh, that explains it”.

My friends don’t seem like very anxious people, but I don’t want to speak too much on that, as I have an general anxiety diagnosis as well and I am fully aware that the face you present to the world does not necessarily correlate with your personal struggles. My issue is that both of my friends are pre-med. Both want to be surgeons. If they cannot complete a chemistry exam within the time given due to the undue stress it puts them under, how are they going to handle surgery, when someone’s very life is at risk? You can’t ask for extra time on that. 

I don’t think that accommodations based on test anxiety should never be allowed. I recognize that there are lots of jobs like engineers, computer scientists, businesspeople, etc. who do not perform their jobs under the same stressful conditions as a timed examination, and can simply work on whatever project they’ve been given at a slower pace, or whatever it may be. My issue is that some professions do not afford this, and so students should not be able to get these accommodations if they are studying to enter one of these professions. The jobs that comes to mind is surgeon/doctor, and a courtroom lawyer. If you cannot operate under stressful conditions, I don’t think you could do these jobs. 

It is because of my own anxiety that I am not pursuing a career in either of these fields, because I understand I am not cut out for these fields. I do not respond well to stress at all, and I know these demanding jobs would be a detriment both to me mentally and to whoever I was trying to help. This is fine, as there are a myriad of other jobs I can have. 

I guess it comes down to the fact that I, as an anxiety sufferer, cannot imagine that someone who gets so anxious while taking a written exam (that one can argue at the end of the day means very little) that they have to have extra time (one has double the time) to do it could even consider a profession where you have to make snap decisions about someone’s life. My friends do better on exams by virtue of the fact that they are no longer rushed and have time to complete and fully think through all the questions, so a part of me wonders whether the accommodation is just another way of keeping GPAs high for medical school. 

To me it feels like a blind person trying to become a surgeon, both have limitations that mean they are not suited for the job at hand. That’s totally okay, they can receive accommodations necessary to perform other jobs. I think that a student should be able to have accommodations for test anxiety or they should be able to pursue a high-stress career, but not both.

I believe that divorce laws in various parts of the world have a very outdated conception of the social role of women. She is seen as unable to generate for the family, since decades ago either women did not work, or the salary was much lower than that of a man, making it impossible to be able to live without depending on a husband. Many divorces favor women more. But times have changed.

And I will be referring to marriages between men and women here, but the logic would also fit into same-sex marriages.

Today, some families have women as their main provider, and there is no equal wage difference like the old times. A working woman is no longer frowned upon. There is no reason why unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement, the division of assets is divided equally, or there are more benefits in divorce for women. I believe that during a divorce, the amount of assets that each will have must equal the financial contribution of each one during the marriage and that should be the only factor to be taken into account.

Yes, I believe that housewives do not deserve to finish anything bought by the husband from a divorce. Psychological support is no longer a valid argument for anyone who is sustained in a society in which everyone can work. It is not just because she will end up with nothing that she deserves something she didn’t work to achieve.

Honestly, I have never heard of a divorce in which the woman ended up at a disadvantage that did not involve a well-written nuptial agreement that protected the man.

And children's pensions should also be reviewed. I believe that there should be a better control of the one who gives the money on the end that it will be destined. All money from these pensions should go to children.

I believe that women and feminism fought hard to reach the equality we enjoy in many parts of the world, and I believe that the way in which divorce is carried out has a vestige of an idea that women should be protected. The advantages we have during divorce must be eradicated to reflect our era.

,changemyview,"**Nihilism**

&gt;**Nihilism** is the point of view that suspends belief in any or all general aspects of human life, which are culturally accepted. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nihilism is useful as a starting point for an intellectual exercise to better understand a cultural concept. It is not, however, a sustainable philosophy to build a society around.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to form a functioning society, there must be an overarching culture that binds people together. This culture must be built from some axioms that can be used to orient that culture's direction of development over time. For example, western liberalism (most of western civilization) is built from the axioms that human life has intrinsic value and the individual is sacred. These are concepts that emerged from the enlightenment and were derived from Judaeo-Christian tradition. It is useful to take a nihilistic approach when analyzing these axioms, to instead question why these assertions are true rather than assuming they are true, but nihilism cannot provide the necessary foundation on which to form a society because it questions the very concept of an axiom. It is not a starting point from which a society can build a culture and orient its development.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hedonism**

&gt;**Hedonism** is a school of thought that argues seeking pleasure and avoiding suffering are the only components of well-being. Ethical hedonism is the view that combines hedonism with welfarist ethics, which claim that what we should do depends exclusively on what affects the well-being individuals have. Ethical hedonists would defend either increasing pleasure and reducing suffering for all beings capable of experiencing them, or just reducing suffering in the case of negative consequentialism. According to negative utilitarianism, only the minimization of suffering would matter. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedonism is unhealthy for a society two ways. The first being directly through the adoption of its tenants into culture, and the second being indirectly through the adoption of its tenants by individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

Directly adopting tenants of  hedonism into a culture poses one large problem: *There is no objective means by which to measure pleasure and suffering.* Firstly this is a logistical issue, if your goal is to reduce suffering, whose suffering takes priority and how is that determination made. You cannot reduce everyone's suffering simultaneously and equally. Secondly, this will inevitably cause conflict. What reduces one person's suffering might increase the suffering of another. What might be pleasurable for one could be suffering for another.

&amp;#x200B;

Individuals adopting hedonism as a personal philosophy also creates problems. In addition to the conflicts mentioned above, on a psychological level, some suffering is required to give life meaning. In he process of overcoming adversity in an attempt to achieve a higher goal, encountering adversity will always lead to some form of suffering. We are aware of this, and subconsciously we crave this adversity, we are always the hero in our own story, when there is no dragon to battle against we create our own to justify ourselves, most recently becoming evident in the concept of *first-world problems*. This idea I feel was best illustrated in Fyodor Dostoyevski's *Notes from the Underground:*

&gt;Even if man were nothing but a piano key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of sheer ingratitude, simply to have his own way…then, after all, perhaps only by his curse will he attain his object, that is, really convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated…then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and have this own way.",t2_147uuy,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: Nihilism and Hedonism are unhealthy philosophies that ruin societies.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfjcyi,FALSE,dark,0.59,,public,3,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,3,,TRUE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588928682,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nihilism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nihilism&lt;/strong&gt; is the point of view that suspends belief in any or all general aspects of human life, which are culturally accepted. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nihilism is useful as a starting point for an intellectual exercise to better understand a cultural concept. It is not, however, a sustainable philosophy to build a society around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to form a functioning society, there must be an overarching culture that binds people together. This culture must be built from some axioms that can be used to orient that culture&amp;#39;s direction of development over time. For example, western liberalism (most of western civilization) is built from the axioms that human life has intrinsic value and the individual is sacred. These are concepts that emerged from the enlightenment and were derived from Judaeo-Christian tradition. It is useful to take a nihilistic approach when analyzing these axioms, to instead question why these assertions are true rather than assuming they are true, but nihilism cannot provide the necessary foundation on which to form a society because it questions the very concept of an axiom. It is not a starting point from which a society can build a culture and orient its development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedonism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Also, I am a layman, I have no academic understanding of this subject, it is just a view that I keep returning to when Im faced with the the subject of ‘fixing society’.

Here goes: I believe that the common issues with our society, for example: climate change, wealth inequality, corruption and racism, stem from the idea that human nature ultimately creates a hierarchical structure in society. Those on ‘top’ (without realising or not) will end up maintaining/asserting their position through oppression and domination of those lower in the hierarchy. 

This structure is unsustainable in the world today because it allows those at the ‘top’ of the hierarchy to consume and hog resources in a way that will ultimately lead to resource depletion and the collapse of society. 

This unsustainability is what has lead to our current environmental crisis. The inequality that it creates fosters racism and hate. Corruption occurs because those at the ‘top’ do not want to lose their positions. There are other issues that exist as a result as well.

The reason I believe we cannot ‘fix’ society is because I think this hierarchical structure is built into our nature, and no matter what we do we will end up returning to this unsustainable society.

Efforts to change our society historically have resulted in a return to the hierarchy. Some examples: communism in Russia, socialism in Venezuela, and Chinese communism.

,changemyview,"It is no doubt that social media breed misinformation and conspiracy theories. Sites such as Facebook or Twitter are especially good at being a nesting ground for antivaxx, 5g lunatics, big pharma, etc. They keep on spreading their unfounded beliefs to their loyal fanbase. This is where the block user functionality sucks.

See, whenever a party wants to contrast their belief, they are immediately blocked. There is no way of pushing contrasting beliefs into a discussion, as you will just get blocked. This breeds echo-chambers, which are destructive, and lead to only more of conspiracies and idiocracy. Taking into consideration this, the block user function has a negative effect.However, I acknowledge that the function has been designed to help prevent doxxing, as well as insults, stalking and other harmful acts. Although the efficiency of blocking users in preventing insulting messages is not something that is entirely efficient, I can agree to assume that the block user function plays some role in preventing these acts. I also acknowledge that this was the reason it was designed. However, people abuse the power they have. Hence, I think that the function should be changed because it is used in a way that creates destructive communities and breeds echo-chambers.

Here is how I envision the change, however, this is obviously a matter that should be analyzed and considered by many, not a sole redditor. A person should have to choose the reason they are blocking someone. After they click ""block user"", there should be a prompt that asks for reason, such as for instance: ""the user is insulting"", ""the user is harassing"", ""doxxing"", ""spam"", etc. similarly to how a report function works. The user would then be blocked immediately, however, the claim would then be checked by a human supervisor, similarly to how it works with reports. Of course, all of these are matter to discussion. The reason it (In my opinion) should work this way is that there already exists the option to Mute a person on Twitter and Facebook, therefore, if a person does not want to see the comments, they can just mute the person. Nowadays, many users use ""block"" function instead of ""mute"", which means that they basically prevent their point from being contrasted by others (effectively breeding echo chambers).

Edit: I think I need to clarify that this post is about blocking, not muting.

,changemyview,"Obviously communism v. capitalism was and is a huge debate that's divided people, but I believe that the divide is too extreme/polar. Whether or not you believe in implementing communism as a governmental structure / society, the main points of The Communist Manifesto are relevant and hold true today. Even if you're a capitalist, there is no denying that Marx's beliefs, theories and predictions are true, because we're living in a time where it is seen every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not personally an advocate for full blown communism; however I do favor the governments that have more socialist practices, like how in some Nordic countries, they offer universal healthcare, free higher education, and other 'socialist' advantages for the people. However, let's put aside the practice of communist governments in real life. My CMV statement/argument is essentially this: you can be a capitalist and understand and support Marx's theories, ideas, and moral standards for society. You can be a capitalist while criticizing the flaws of capitalism. Whether or not you believe in communist governments, the theory behind communism and Marx's piece is undeniably true today. Some of the strong and relevant points he makes:

\- Capitalism is built on and exploits the working class and encourages class struggle and inequality

\-The bourgeois exploits the proletariat for gaining more capital, while the working class must sell themselves (in some way, whether it's time, health, their safety, etc.) to survive

\-Capitalism is unstable and unsustainable, and the working class will revolt, moving a society from capitalism to socialism and eventually to communism (note: you can disagree with implementing communism in governments, but it's hard to deny that this cycle often happens, where the working class stands up for themselves and wants to slowly transition into a communist practice -- it's happening now in America).

\-The workers will unite and take positions of power, representing the working class

I mean lots of what Marx says is happening now. The working class is using media, mass communication, unionizing, storytelling, protesting, and other methods to gain power and representation.

This tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth.

Disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet, but mark my words, there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by Disney to fit their idea of what it should be. 

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way. 

Disney owns too much and has the power to do too much. Let me make another example. Star Wars. I know, I know, “TLJ sucked, not canon! Duurrrrr!” I’m not here to bash the movies. I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that! Star Wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed, the rest could have done whatever it wanted! Here’s another one, Star Wars: Battlefront II the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco (gambling in games that kids can access). I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. 

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

&lt;p&gt;1) I’m not an economist and my knowledge of this topic has been broadened immensely from just hearing what some of you had to say, so thank you for enlightening a dull individual such as myself. It has changed my view in some areas of this discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Comcast is NOT owned by Disney, I misread that detail when doing a quick research. I’m sorry for mixing that up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) My terminology is not entirely accurate since I’m not as privy to the business side. But the spirit of the post is still intact and is directed at Disney having the control and influence over media and the ability to possibly censor or influence future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

The most succinct way to describe my view is as the cornell link describes the ""collectives rights theory"":  

&gt;On the other hand, some scholars point to the prefatory language ""a well regulated Militia"" to argue that the Framers intended only to restrict Congress from legislating away a state's right to self-defense. Scholars have come to call this theory ""the collective rights theory.""

&gt; A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 

So let's elaborate on my point of view. Why do I subscribe to the collectives rights theory (CRT) instead of the individual rights theory (IRT)? I'm neither for or against guns per se, as in I hold no political opinion on gun control (so you'll have a rather hard time arguing with me on a political basis because I really don't care).

Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a 'Glow up'. I think this kind of attitude is just thinly veiled bitterness and jealousy that someone has acheived something fantastic that they are happy with and proud of.

Adele was always a great singer and performer and arguably pretty too but she looks amazing now and very happy and if people are congratulating her I think it's wonderful. The mental gymnastics of people that are suggesting she might have depression, a drug addiction or even cancer is just a pathetic attempt at finding excuses for why she was able to do something that others can't. And it's all false too because she has been very open for YEARS about wanting to lose weight for various reasons. She cut out sugar in her tea (true brit), hired a trainer and a nutritionist etc, she worked really really hard and its just sad people that can't be happy for her.

The first guy saying some stupid shit about her looking like a sorority girl about to marry into old money doesn't even make fucking sense, but the retweet is just as bad saying that people like fat people getting thin (and healthier) too much. The woman retweeting is extremely fat and openly trying to use that to make herself a model so she has a vested interest in being obese not being seen as the negative thing that it is.

I also think it is disingenous to suggest this isn't a 'glow up'. What is the actual definition? From what I've seen it's literally just pictures of people age 15-18 or something then them in their 20s all done up with makeup. The whole idea of a 'glow up' is already vapid and shallow and suggesting Adele's doesn't count when it looks more like it than most others just shows the disingenuous nature of these people's attitude.

,changemyview,"[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/) by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health. There are sometimes seem as a newer drug epidemic set to spar off with the opioid epidemic for it's debilitating effects on public health. 

Benzodiazapines are a class of minor tranquilizer/sedative drugs that are less potent than their older, less safe equivalent barbiturates. They act positive allostatic modulators of the GABA-subtype A receptor and it's various subtypes of binding cites. By pulling in an influx of negatively charged chloride ions, they inhibit the firing of a neuron, thereby decreasing brain activity globally. Alcohol works as a GABA agonist as well, and also antagonizes the common excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, from which GABA is synthesized. 

GABA says ""stop"", glutamate says ""go"". This will be an important dichotomy to bear in mind. Currently, benzodiazapines like Vallium (diazapam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Atavian (lorazepam) are classified under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as Schedule IV class drugs. By being a controlled substance, a drug's availability becomes subject to extra legislation that non-scheduled drugs are not. For instance, refills on classes III-V expire after six months from the time they are written, which is normally a year for unscheduled drugs. Schedule II drugs require a new prescription every refill, and cannot have automatic refills attached to them. Meaning your doctor must write a new one each month. Also in the case of Schedule II, no more than a 30 day supple of the drug can be prescribed on one prescription. Which means if you take it once a day, you get 30 max. Penalties for illegal possession are also higher.  

So, my case is that benzodiazapines, as well as the non-benzodiazapine hypnotic ""Z-drugs"" such as Ambien and Lunesta, should be reclassified from Schedule IV to Schedule II. My argument for this is that benzodiazapines are addictive, highly abusable, and deadly. Withdrawal can last months, if not years. Longer than opioid withdrawal by a country mile. Abuse and chronic use of Benzodiazapines can cause tolerance to build, resulting in the uncoupling and down-regulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation or increased genetic expression of NMDA receptors, the brain's main glutamate receptor. This creates excito-toxicity in the brain that can cause apoptosis (neuron cell death, often permanent in most areas of the brain), long term structural and functional disturbances, and most famous of all, seizures! None of that is pleasant. 

Now you might be thinking ""Well hang on, by adding extra regulations, couldn't that get many people taken off their medication?"" 

Yes, it might. But the few conditions benzodiazapines are FDA approved to treat (insomnia, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and epilepsy) are finding new and alternative treatments. Anxiety disorders have antidepressants, BuSpar, or just plain old exercise. Insomnia has antihistamines (including prescription ones), exercise, and improvements in sleep hygiene. The only disorders I stand by giving benzodiazapines to as a first line treatment is for panic disorder and epilepsy. Those conditions benefit far more from chronic treatment than does anxiety and sleep disorders, both of which have plenty of alternative treatment options. 

The dangers and risks of benzodiazapines are pretty apparent, so I advise you not disregard those factors when trying to change my view. Also, as I see a lot in drug-related debates, deflecting to another drug or issue is not a valid argument in my eyes. Yes, opioids are currently more deadly.

Alcohol works as a GABA agonist as well, and also antagonizes the common excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, from which GABA is synthesized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GABA says &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot;, glutamate says &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;. This will be an important dichotomy to bear in mind. Currently, benzodiazapines like Vallium (diazapam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Atavian (lorazepam) are classified under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as Schedule IV class drugs. By being a controlled substance, a drug&amp;#39;s availability becomes subject to extra legislation that non-scheduled drugs are not. For instance, refills on classes III-V expire after six months from the time they are written, which is normally a year for unscheduled drugs. Schedule II drugs require a new prescription every refill, and cannot have automatic refills attached to them. Meaning your doctor must write a new one each month. Also in the case of Schedule II, no more than a 30 day supple of the drug can be prescribed on one prescription. Which means if you take it once a day, you get 30 max. Penalties for illegal possession are also higher.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my case is that benzodiazapines, as well as the non-benzodiazapine hypnotic &amp;quot;Z-drugs&amp;quot; such as Ambien and Lunesta, should be reclassified from Schedule IV to Schedule II. My argument for this is that benzodiazapines are addictive, highly abusable, and deadly. Withdrawal can last months, if not years. Longer than opioid withdrawal by a country mile. Abuse and chronic use of Benzodiazapines can cause tolerance to build, resulting in the uncoupling and down-regulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation or increased genetic expression of NMDA receptors, the brain&amp;#39;s main glutamate receptor. This creates excito-toxicity in the brain that can cause apoptosis (neuron cell death, often permanent in most areas of the brain), long term structural and functional disturbances, and most famous of all, seizures! None of that is pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might be thinking &amp;quot;Well hang on, by adding extra regulations, couldn&amp;#39;t that get many people taken off their medication?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it might. But the few conditions benzodiazapines are FDA approved to treat (insomnia, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and epilepsy) are finding new and alternative treatments. Anxiety disorders have antidepressants, BuSpar, or just plain old exercise. Insomnia has antihistamines (including prescription ones), exercise, and improvements in sleep hygiene. The only disorders I stand by giving benzodiazapines to as a first line treatment is for panic disorder and epilepsy. Those conditions benefit far more from chronic treatment than does anxiety and sleep disorders, both of which have plenty of alternative treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dangers and risks of benzodiazapines are pretty apparent, so I advise you not disregard those factors when trying to change my view. Also, as I see a lot in drug-related debates, deflecting to another drug or issue is not a valid argument in my eyes. Yes, opioids are currently more deadly. That does not reduce the harms benzodiazapines are causing.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"Do I think fat people should be shamed for the extra weight they carry? No. Do I think they should be praised for carrying it proudly? No

By promoting body positivity we're telling people essentially that any body type is okay. And while I'm not saying we should all be athletic gods and goddesses, no one should be happy with or encouraged to be proud of their overweight.

Obese people die sooner and have worse health complications. By telling young, impressionable people that their bodies are perfect just the way they are, we are promoting children to develop bad eating and exercise habits because we lie and tell them that their body is beautiful.

Body neutrality is better because it should be okay to hate parts of your body and want to change them. As I said, fat people shouldn't be shamed because of their lack of health. But honestly, obesity is gross, unhealthy, and leads to things like a higher chance of heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cancer, etc. 

Body positivity doesn't promote a healthy person as a whole. While it may \*superficially \*help their mental health it doesn't benefit their physical health which is equally important.

Edit: sorry I came here to try and learn from a good argument. So many people are downvoting my comments. I honestly don't care do as you want. But I'm unsure if that's the best option when an opinion doesn't work with yours

Edit 2: if you're going to put down well people with [very specific condition] can't help but be fat that still isn't an argument for body positivity imo but you'll comment anyways so what do I care

I'm saying as a society we shouldn't promote unhealthy body types. If you're here to say something off topic I'm really not interested in responding.

First off. I'll say that it's okay to not like a comic, or to not like it's story or characters or message/moral. That's an opinion and it's okay to have one. Simply saying politics should stay out of comics is not valid. I'm not saying every comic needs or even has a political message, some are just dumb fun.

However, throughout the publication history of comics there have been many cases in which the writer/creator injects topical and political elements into the stories. From the very creation of the superhero genre, politics has been part of the story. Superman, the first superhero, is an illegal alien created by two Jewish guys in the 1930s.

People only complain because they don't like the message. The same people complaining that Iceman is gay now are totally fine with the X-men as a whole. The X-men were an obvious allegory for race relations when they were created and now are compared with LGBT rights.

Essentially; politics are, always have been, and should continue to be a part or comics. Those who complain about it only disagree with the specific message.

,changemyview,"This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele's weight loss *rolls eyes*
It's been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it's because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. 

But let's be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I'll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It's not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? 

Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let's face it. Losing weight sucks and it's really really hard. It's so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that's why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I've seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.

Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I'm trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It's not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. 

And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn't have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as. So if you truly see yourself for how and always as being overweight and you know why the love yourself and good things will come into your life.",t2_5kxee6kc,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: fat shaming isnt about body positivity and the fallout on social media of adele losing weight is a good example of that.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfiffa,FALSE,dark,0.64,,public,8,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,8,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588925275,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele&amp;#39;s weight loss &lt;em&gt;rolls eyes&lt;/em&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it&amp;#39;s because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I&amp;#39;ll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It&amp;#39;s not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let&amp;#39;s face it. Losing weight sucks and it&amp;#39;s really really hard. It&amp;#39;s so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that&amp;#39;s why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I&amp;#39;ve seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I&amp;#39;m trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It&amp;#39;s not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn&amp;#39;t have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as. So if you truly see yourself for how and always as being overweight and you know why the love yourself and good things will come into your life.&lt;/p&gt;

I was the classic nerd you have seen in the movies that was always the last to be picked on when I had physical education in school and we had to play multiple sports.

We had to go on Wednesdays at 7AM to an open field that was right next to the ocean, in winter, only for him to give us a ball and tell us to play football (soccer). Of course everyone knew how to play but I didn't, they never taught us a single rule because apparently most Argentinians have this programmed into their DNA but it seems I did not. I was repeatedly humiliated by this 'professor', once he made me stood 15 minutes that seemed an eternity until I was able to get the ball on the other side of the net during volleyball class, while everyone laughed at me. 

When I went to college I was kind of surprised because I started meeting new, good people who loved the same things I did, but apparently many of them were fit and loved going to the gym or practicing sports like running or surfing. It seemed the stereotype, the personality pack that I had bought for so many years, wasn't real after all.

I have never been obese, i was a little overweight during short periods, but I have never been fit in my entire life.

It doesn't help that I have never been able to appreciate positive physical changes in my body after exercising, probably because I have never done it more than two or three months in a row.

,changemyview,"
Ok so I am very much hoping that someone on here can really change my view because I do feel awful saying this, but it’s been something on my mind. So here’s where I’m at:

I go to one of the top universities in the US, and our undergraduate program is heavily dominated by pre-med folk. Because it’s an elite university, there are a good chunk of students from wealthy families here. While my school was not specifically indicted by the whole college admissions scandal a year ago, I can’t help but see some of the privileges wealth can buy in getting ahead in competitive programs, and wonder whether there are some more insidious ways people are helping their children (aside from lying that their kids are on sports teams lol). 

Two of my good friends at this school are pre-med and have extra time accommodations on exams due to test anxiety. Both come from wealthy East Coast families and both are VERY smart (I don’t think they would be at this school if they weren’t!). I am not pre-med so I don’t take the classes a huge portion of the undergraduate population does, but I obviously know and speak with a lot of pre-meds, and word always spreads like wildfire after chemistry tests, and the general consensus is always that they are insanely hard because everything is too rushed and many people don’t finish on time. My two friends, however, have never complained to me of this. At the beginning of the year, before I found out about their accommodations (I only found out because they were in the same class as me second semester and were not present in the exam room with me, so I asked where they were and they explained), I was just really in awe of how they could fly through an exam and get impeccable grades on them. Then after I learned about the accommodations, I found myself thinking “Oh, that explains it”.

My friends don’t seem like very anxious people, but I don’t want to speak too much on that, as I have an general anxiety diagnosis as well and I am fully aware that the face you present to the world does not necessarily correlate with your personal struggles. My issue is that both of my friends are pre-med. Both want to be surgeons. If they cannot complete a chemistry exam within the time given due to the undue stress it puts them under, how are they going to handle surgery, when someone’s very life is at risk? You can’t ask for extra time on that. 

I don’t think that accommodations based on test anxiety should never be allowed. I recognize that there are lots of jobs like engineers, computer scientists, businesspeople, etc. who do not perform their jobs under the same stressful conditions as a timed examination, and can simply work on whatever project they’ve been given at a slower pace, or whatever it may be. My issue is that some professions do not afford this, and so students should not be able to get these accommodations if they are studying to enter one of these professions. The jobs that comes to mind is surgeon/doctor, and a courtroom lawyer. If you cannot operate under stressful conditions, I don’t think you could do these jobs. 

It is because of my own anxiety that I am not pursuing a career in either of these fields, because I understand I am not cut out for these fields. I do not respond well to stress at all, and I know these demanding jobs would be a detriment both to me mentally and to whoever I was trying to help. This is fine, as there are a myriad of other jobs I can have. 

I guess it comes down to the fact that I, as an anxiety sufferer, cannot imagine that someone who gets so anxious while taking a written exam (that one can argue at the end of the day means very little) that they have to have extra time (one has double the time) to do it could even consider a profession where you have to make snap decisions about someone’s life. My friends do better on exams by virtue of the fact that they are no longer rushed and have time to complete and fully think through all the questions, so a part of me wonders whether the accommodation is just another way of keeping GPAs high for medical school. 

To me it feels like a blind person trying to become a surgeon, both have limitations that mean they are not suited for the job at hand. That’s totally okay, they can receive accommodations necessary to perform other jobs. I think that a student should be able to have accommodations for test anxiety or they should be able to pursue a high-stress career, but not both.

,changemyview,"First of all, I am a woman.

I believe that divorce laws in various parts of the world have a very outdated conception of the social role of women. She is seen as unable to generate for the family, since decades ago either women did not work, or the salary was much lower than that of a man, making it impossible to be able to live without depending on a husband. Many divorces favor women more. But times have changed.

And I will be referring to marriages between men and women here, but the logic would also fit into same-sex marriages.

Today, some families have women as their main provider, and there is no equal wage difference like the old times. A working woman is no longer frowned upon. There is no reason why unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement, the division of assets is divided equally, or there are more benefits in divorce for women. I believe that during a divorce, the amount of assets that each will have must equal the financial contribution of each one during the marriage and that should be the only factor to be taken into account.

Yes, I believe that housewives do not deserve to finish anything bought by the husband from a divorce. Psychological support is no longer a valid argument for anyone who is sustained in a society in which everyone can work. It is not just because she will end up with nothing that she deserves something she didn’t work to achieve.

Honestly, I have never heard of a divorce in which the woman ended up at a disadvantage that did not involve a well-written nuptial agreement that protected the man.

And children's pensions should also be reviewed. I believe that there should be a better control of the one who gives the money on the end that it will be destined. All money from these pensions should go to children.

I believe that women and feminism fought hard to reach the equality we enjoy in many parts of the world, and I believe that the way in which divorce is carried out has a vestige of an idea that women should be protected. The advantages we have during divorce must be eradicated to reflect our era.

There is no reason why unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement, the division of assets is divided equally, or there are more benefits in divorce for women. I believe that during a divorce, the amount of assets that each will have must equal the financial contribution of each one during the marriage and that should be the only factor to be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I believe that housewives do not deserve to finish anything bought by the husband from a divorce. Psychological support is no longer a valid argument for anyone who is sustained in a society in which everyone can work. It is not just because she will end up with nothing that she deserves something she didn’t work to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I have never heard of a divorce in which the woman ended up at a disadvantage that did not involve a well-written nuptial agreement that protected the man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And children&amp;#39;s pensions should also be reviewed. I believe that there should be a better control of the one who gives the money on the end that it will be destined. All money from these pensions should go to children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that women and feminism fought hard to reach the equality we enjoy in many parts of the world, and I believe that the way in which divorce is carried out has a vestige of an idea that women should be protected. The advantages we have during divorce must be eradicated to reflect our era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in this post I am not talking about the laws of a specific country, but in general.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"**Nihilism**

&gt;**Nihilism** is the point of view that suspends belief in any or all general aspects of human life, which are culturally accepted. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nihilism is useful as a starting point for an intellectual exercise to better understand a cultural concept. It is not, however, a sustainable philosophy to build a society around.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to form a functioning society, there must be an overarching culture that binds people together. This culture must be built from some axioms that can be used to orient that culture's direction of development over time. For example, western liberalism (most of western civilization) is built from the axioms that human life has intrinsic value and the individual is sacred. These are concepts that emerged from the enlightenment and were derived from Judaeo-Christian tradition. It is useful to take a nihilistic approach when analyzing these axioms, to instead question why these assertions are true rather than assuming they are true, but nihilism cannot provide the necessary foundation on which to form a society because it questions the very concept of an axiom. It is not a starting point from which a society can build a culture and orient its development.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hedonism**

&gt;**Hedonism** is a school of thought that argues seeking pleasure and avoiding suffering are the only components of well-being. Ethical hedonism is the view that combines hedonism with welfarist ethics, which claim that what we should do depends exclusively on what affects the well-being individuals have. Ethical hedonists would defend either increasing pleasure and reducing suffering for all beings capable of experiencing them, or just reducing suffering in the case of negative consequentialism. According to negative utilitarianism, only the minimization of suffering would matter. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedonism is unhealthy for a society two ways. The first being directly through the adoption of its tenants into culture, and the second being indirectly through the adoption of its tenants by individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

Directly adopting tenants of  hedonism into a culture poses one large problem: *There is no objective means by which to measure pleasure and suffering.* Firstly this is a logistical issue, if your goal is to reduce suffering, whose suffering takes priority and how is that determination made. You cannot reduce everyone's suffering simultaneously and equally. Secondly, this will inevitably cause conflict. What reduces one person's suffering might increase the suffering of another. What might be pleasurable for one could be suffering for another.

&amp;#x200B;

Individuals adopting hedonism as a personal philosophy also creates problems. In addition to the conflicts mentioned above, on a psychological level, some suffering is required to give life meaning. In he process of overcoming adversity in an attempt to achieve a higher goal, encountering adversity will always lead to some form of suffering. We are aware of this, and subconsciously we crave this adversity, we are always the hero in our own story, when there is no dragon to battle against we create our own to justify ourselves, most recently becoming evident in the concept of *first-world problems*. This idea I feel was best illustrated in Fyodor Dostoyevski's *Notes from the Underground:*

&gt;Even if man were nothing but a piano key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of sheer ingratitude, simply to have his own way…then, after all, perhaps only by his curse will he attain his object, that is, really convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key!

Here goes: I believe that the common issues with our society, for example: climate change, wealth inequality, corruption and racism, stem from the idea that human nature ultimately creates a hierarchical structure in society.

Some of the strong and relevant points he makes:

\- Capitalism is built on and exploits the working class and encourages class struggle and inequality

\-The bourgeois exploits the proletariat for gaining more capital, while the working class must sell themselves (in some way, whether it's time, health, their safety, etc.) to survive

\-Capitalism is unstable and unsustainable, and the working class will revolt, moving a society from capitalism to socialism and eventually to communism (note: you can disagree with implementing communism in governments, but it's hard to deny that this cycle often happens, where the working class stands up for themselves and wants to slowly transition into a communist practice -- it's happening now in America).

\-The workers will unite and take positions of power, representing the working class

See, whenever a party wants to contrast their belief, they are immediately blocked. There is no way of pushing contrasting beliefs into a discussion, as you will just get blocked. This breeds echo-chambers, which are destructive, and lead to only more of conspiracies and idiocracy. Taking into consideration this, the block user function has a negative effect.However, I acknowledge that the function has been designed to help prevent doxxing, as well as insults, stalking and other harmful acts.

Hence, I think that the function should be changed because it is used in a way that creates destructive communities and breeds echo-chambers.

Here is how I envision the change, however, this is obviously a matter that should be analyzed and considered by many, not a sole redditor. A person should have to choose the reason they are blocking someone. After they click ""block user"", there should be a prompt that asks for reason, such as for instance: ""the user is insulting"", ""the user is harassing"", ""doxxing"", ""spam"", etc. similarly to how a report function works. The user would then be blocked immediately, however, the claim would then be checked by a human supervisor, similarly to how it works with reports. Of course, all of these are matter to discussion. The reason it (In my opinion) should work this way is that there already exists the option to Mute a person on Twitter and Facebook, therefore, if a person does not want to see the comments, they can just mute the person. Nowadays, many users use ""block"" function instead of ""mute"", which means that they basically prevent their point from being contrasted by others (effectively breeding echo chambers).

Edit: I think I need to clarify that this post is about blocking, not muting. While muting means that you never see posts/comments from the person, blocking means that you disallow someone from ever responding to your posts, effectively preventing both yourself, as well as all your followers from seeing the post.",t2_lgrta,FALSE,,0,FALSE,"CMV: Social Media sites need to redesign ""block user"" functionality.",[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,FTFdelta,0,FALSE,t3_gfnhf9,FALSE,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},Delta(s) from OP - Fresh Topic Friday,FALSE,0,,FALSE,,1588923138,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588946421,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no doubt that social media breed misinformation and conspiracy theories. Sites such as Facebook or Twitter are especially good at being a nesting ground for antivaxx, 5g lunatics, big pharma, etc. They keep on spreading their unfounded beliefs to their loyal fanbase. This is where the block user functionality sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, whenever a party wants to contrast their belief, they are immediately blocked. There is no way of pushing contrasting beliefs into a discussion, as you will just get blocked. This breeds echo-chambers, which are destructive, and lead to only more of conspiracies and idiocracy. Taking into consideration this, the block user function has a negative effect.However, I acknowledge that the function has been designed to help prevent doxxing, as well as insults, stalking and other harmful acts.

This tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth.

Disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet, but mark my words, there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by Disney to fit their idea of what it should be. 

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way. 

Disney owns too much and has the power to do too much. Let me make another example. Star Wars. I know, I know, “TLJ sucked, not canon! Duurrrrr!” I’m not here to bash the movies. I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that! Star Wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed, the rest could have done whatever it wanted! Here’s another one, Star Wars: Battlefront II the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco (gambling in games that kids can access). I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. 

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a 'Glow up'. I think this kind of attitude is just thinly veiled bitterness and jealousy that someone has acheived something fantastic that they are happy with and proud of.

Adele was always a great singer and performer and arguably pretty too but she looks amazing now and very happy and if people are congratulating her I think it's wonderful. The mental gymnastics of people that are suggesting she might have depression, a drug addiction or even cancer is just a pathetic attempt at finding excuses for why she was able to do something that others can't. And it's all false too because she has been very open for YEARS about wanting to lose weight for various reasons. She cut out sugar in her tea (true brit), hired a trainer and a nutritionist etc, she worked really really hard and its just sad people that can't be happy for her.

This kind of tweet and retweet is what I mean:  [https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454](https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454)

The first guy saying some stupid shit about her looking like a sorority girl about to marry into old money doesn't even make fucking sense, but the retweet is just as bad saying that people like fat people getting thin (and healthier) too much. The woman retweeting is extremely fat and openly trying to use that to make herself a model so she has a vested interest in being obese not being seen as the negative thing that it is.

I also think it is disingenous to suggest this isn't a 'glow up'. What is the actual definition? From what I've seen it's literally just pictures of people age 15-18 or something then them in their 20s all done up with makeup. The whole idea of a 'glow up' is already vapid and shallow and suggesting Adele's doesn't count when it looks more like it than most others just shows the disingenuous nature of these people's attitude.

&lt;p&gt;But look at the Trump government, he appoints his daughter to something, his son-in-law to something, his son to something, his billionaire friends to something, why? because the people were asked to vote not for what the policy positions/parties they believe in, but what person they believe in, and have no further say in what he does once he assumes office. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gfd7hf/justice_dept_dropping_flynns_criminal_case/fpsucig?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x""&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gf3u70/just_straight_cronyism_top_trump_and_gop_donor/""&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and so many more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also inhibits the springing of multiple parties by creating a winner-takes-all system, where either you are in power or you are not in power, whereas, in a parliamentary system, even if you don&amp;#39;t form the government you have some power/say in the direction the country takes.

,changemyview,"[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/) by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health. There are sometimes seem as a newer drug epidemic set to spar off with the opioid epidemic for it's debilitating effects on public health. 

Benzodiazapines are a class of minor tranquilizer/sedative drugs that are less potent than their older, less safe equivalent barbiturates. They act positive allostatic modulators of the GABA-subtype A receptor and it's various subtypes of binding cites. By pulling in an influx of negatively charged chloride ions, they inhibit the firing of a neuron, thereby decreasing brain activity globally. Alcohol works as a GABA agonist as well, and also antagonizes the common excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, from which GABA is synthesized. 

GABA says ""stop"", glutamate says ""go"". This will be an important dichotomy to bear in mind. Currently, benzodiazapines like Vallium (diazapam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Atavian (lorazepam) are classified under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as Schedule IV class drugs. By being a controlled substance, a drug's availability becomes subject to extra legislation that non-scheduled drugs are not. For instance, refills on classes III-V expire after six months from the time they are written, which is normally a year for unscheduled drugs. Schedule II drugs require a new prescription every refill, and cannot have automatic refills attached to them. Meaning your doctor must write a new one each month. Also in the case of Schedule II, no more than a 30 day supple of the drug can be prescribed on one prescription. Which means if you take it once a day, you get 30 max. Penalties for illegal possession are also higher.  

So, my case is that benzodiazapines, as well as the non-benzodiazapine hypnotic ""Z-drugs"" such as Ambien and Lunesta, should be reclassified from Schedule IV to Schedule II. My argument for this is that benzodiazapines are addictive, highly abusable, and deadly. Withdrawal can last months, if not years. Longer than opioid withdrawal by a country mile. Abuse and chronic use of Benzodiazapines can cause tolerance to build, resulting in the uncoupling and down-regulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation or increased genetic expression of NMDA receptors, the brain's main glutamate receptor. This creates excito-toxicity in the brain that can cause apoptosis (neuron cell death, often permanent in most areas of the brain), long term structural and functional disturbances, and most famous of all, seizures! None of that is pleasant. 

Now you might be thinking ""Well hang on, by adding extra regulations, couldn't that get many people taken off their medication?"" 

Yes, it might. But the few conditions benzodiazapines are FDA approved to treat (insomnia, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and epilepsy) are finding new and alternative treatments. Anxiety disorders have antidepressants, BuSpar, or just plain old exercise. Insomnia has antihistamines (including prescription ones), exercise, and improvements in sleep hygiene. The only disorders I stand by giving benzodiazapines to as a first line treatment is for panic disorder and epilepsy. Those conditions benefit far more from chronic treatment than does anxiety and sleep disorders, both of which have plenty of alternative treatment options. 

The dangers and risks of benzodiazapines are pretty apparent, so I advise you not disregard those factors when trying to change my view. Also, as I see a lot in drug-related debates, deflecting to another drug or issue is not a valid argument in my eyes. Yes, opioids are currently more deadly. That does not reduce the harms benzodiazapines are causing.",t2_168wyr,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: Benzodiazapines should be rescheduled under the Controlled Substances Act from Schedule IV to Schedule II,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfktfh,FALSE,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,0,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588934418,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/""&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health.

,changemyview,"Do I think fat people should be shamed for the extra weight they carry? No. Do I think they should be praised for carrying it proudly? No

By promoting body positivity we're telling people essentially that any body type is okay. And while I'm not saying we should all be athletic gods and goddesses, no one should be happy with or encouraged to be proud of their overweight.

Obese people die sooner and have worse health complications. By telling young, impressionable people that their bodies are perfect just the way they are, we are promoting children to develop bad eating and exercise habits because we lie and tell them that their body is beautiful.

Body neutrality is better because it should be okay to hate parts of your body and want to change them. As I said, fat people shouldn't be shamed because of their lack of health. But honestly, obesity is gross, unhealthy, and leads to things like a higher chance of heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cancer, etc. 

Body positivity doesn't promote a healthy person as a whole. While it may \*superficially \*help their mental health it doesn't benefit their physical health which is equally important.

Edit: sorry I came here to try and learn from a good argument. So many people are downvoting my comments. I honestly don't care do as you want. But I'm unsure if that's the best option when an opinion doesn't work with yours

Edit 2: if you're going to put down well people with [very specific condition] can't help but be fat that still isn't an argument for body positivity imo but you'll comment anyways so what do I care

Edit 3: this is becoming a lot for now. It's almost 3 a.m. where I'm at I'll check back in on this in the morning. Lots of people getting really fired up. I cane here for a good argument to help change my view not to be internet yelled at lol. But again, what the hell do I care what y'all do

Edit 4: Wow okay before you comment let me just put up some common misconceptions. I am not saying that we should tell fat people that they are gross straight up to their face. I'm saying as a society we shouldn't promote unhealthy body types. If you're here to say something off topic I'm really not interested in responding. By the kill themselves content in the title in referring to the onslaught of health conditions. I do not care about the time you bribe your leg and gained 20 pounds for 6 months. All I think is that as a society we should printer healthy lifestyle choices

Edit 5: I am open to changing my view and two arguments have struck some change in me. But I'm not fully convinced. I've mentioned in multiple comments that I understand my view is viewed as toxic by many but I dunt have anything compelling to change it

Edit 6: at this point in time people are commenting just to comment and it's getting really off topic. I'm not sure what my sexuality has to do with anything. I appreciate about 10 of you for having good arguments with me and specifically the two of you who gave well worded, non-attack mode arguments. You earned those Delta's for how they helped augment my view from where it was. The other 500+ of you didn't really help much as you either didn't read my post or edits and just started commenting with things I already addressed.",t2_1z514gv,FALSE,,1,FALSE,CMV: Body positivity promotes an unhealthy and toxic culture and makes unhealthy people okay with killing themselves with their weight and associated issues.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,OPdelta,0,FALSE,t3_gewcko,FALSE,dark,0.82,,public,5294,4,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},Delta(s) from OP,FALSE,5294,,TRUE,,1588864350,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,TRUE,,1588840730,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,TRUE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I think fat people should be shamed for the extra weight they carry? No. Do I think they should be praised for carrying it proudly? No&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By promoting body positivity we&amp;#39;re telling people essentially that any body type is okay. And while I&amp;#39;m not saying we should all be athletic gods and goddesses, no one should be happy with or encouraged to be proud of their overweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obese people die sooner and have worse health complications. By telling young, impressionable people that their bodies are perfect just the way they are, we are promoting children to develop bad eating and exercise habits because we lie and tell them that their body is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body neutrality is better because it should be okay to hate parts of your body and want to change them. As I said, fat people shouldn&amp;#39;t be shamed because of their lack of health. But honestly, obesity is gross, unhealthy, and leads to things like a higher chance of heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cancer, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body positivity doesn&amp;#39;t promote a healthy person as a whole. While it may *superficially *help their mental health it doesn&amp;#39;t benefit their physical health which is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: sorry I came here to try and learn from a good argument. So many people are downvoting my comments. I honestly don&amp;#39;t care do as you want. But I&amp;#39;m unsure if that&amp;#39;s the best option when an opinion doesn&amp;#39;t work with yours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: if you&amp;#39;re going to put down well people with [very specific condition] can&amp;#39;t help but be fat that still isn&amp;#39;t an argument for body positivity imo but you&amp;#39;ll comment anyways so what do I care&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"I believe that there are many social opportunities unique to high school that aren't present later in life. I believe the phenomenon of many people being arbitrarily and equally put in a single group and given wide opportunities to socialize provides an environment where people can engage with a diverse group of people that's very difficult to find again later in life. Colleges don't give as good opportunities but the maturity of people there often makes up for it. I think debatably certain college programs may be better for this but it's difficult. I was in a program that was very male-dominated and pseudo diverse since rich people from all over the world came to my college program.

Sex ratio might be an issue specific to people in certain fields but I think the enforced 50-50 sex ratio in high schools makes it very good. In my experience after high school, my social circle went from being 50-50 to being overwhelmingly male, it's at the point that I know more transwomen than ciswomen.

I think the fact that you are constantly in touch with the same people as a part of your everyday life in high school makes it easy to form relationships, platonic and romantic.

,changemyview,"Let me start off with this, I do not condone fat shaming. However, because people take so much of their time to promote fat positivity. They have forgotten to spend time on how to tackle the problem. Fat shaming is very subjective, it only works for some people. But just saying 'Yeah its ok to be fat' does not solve the problem of obesity, the pandemic actually. We need to be putting more time for support of helping people lose weight, this means the slight facelift of the healthcare system. I have read many articles about how doctors 'fat-shame' overweight people, which consequently means these people avoid the doctors because of the fear of being fat-shamed. I think a rework generally of how doctors are trained would help tackle this problem. I think that within the rework, doctors would learn how to refer these people to proper gyms and programs that have extensive support to help these people. Yes, it may cost quite a bit for this rework, but it will mean more people losing weight in the end. Now lets focus on the non-medical professionals. We can also help people lose weight. The people who exercise could politely ask their obese friend, 'Do you want to do a fitness program with me? I will do it at your pace because I am your friend'. Something related to that. This makes obese people feel that they are being supported rather than be shamed and scorned.

However, because people take so much of their time to promote fat positivity. They have forgotten to spend time on how to tackle the problem. Fat shaming is very subjective, it only works for some people. But just saying &amp;#39;Yeah its ok to be fat&amp;#39; does not solve the problem of obesity, the pandemic actually. We need to be putting more time for support of helping people lose weight, this means the slight facelift of the healthcare system. I have read many articles about how doctors &amp;#39;fat-shame&amp;#39; overweight people, which consequently means these people avoid the doctors because of the fear of being fat-shamed. I think a rework generally of how doctors are trained would help tackle this problem. I think that within the rework, doctors would learn how to refer these people to proper gyms and programs that have extensive support to help these people. Yes, it may cost quite a bit for this rework, but it will mean more people losing weight in the end. Now lets focus on the non-medical professionals. We can also help people lose weight. The people who exercise could politely ask their obese friend, &amp;#39;Do you want to do a fitness program with me? I will do it at your pace because I am your friend&amp;#39;. Something related to that. This makes obese people feel that they are being supported rather than be shamed and scorned. This would mean that we would have to change how we approach obese people, willing to help kindly, not &amp;#39;tough love&amp;#39; or mockery. But this would also mean that even more people lose weight. If there are people who refuse all this extensive support, God help them.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"(I'm mostly talking about superhero comics because that is what I am most familiar with, but it also applies to non-superhero books as well.)

First off. I'll say that it's okay to not like a comic, or to not like it's story or characters or message/moral. That's an opinion and it's okay to have one. Simply saying politics should stay out of comics is not valid. I'm not saying every comic needs or even has a political message, some are just dumb fun.

However, throughout the publication history of comics there have been many cases in which the writer/creator injects topical and political elements into the stories. From the very creation of the superhero genre, politics has been part of the story. Superman, the first superhero, is an illegal alien created by two Jewish guys in the 1930s.

People only complain because they don't like the message. The same people complaining that Iceman is gay now are totally fine with the X-men as a whole. The X-men were an obvious allegory for race relations when they were created and now are compared with LGBT rights.

Essentially; politics are, always have been, and should continue to be a part or comics. Those who complain about it only disagree with the specific message.

Ok so I am very much hoping that someone on here can really change my view because I do feel awful saying this, but it’s been something on my mind. So here’s where I’m at:

I go to one of the top universities in the US, and our undergraduate program is heavily dominated by pre-med folk. Because it’s an elite university, there are a good chunk of students from wealthy families here. While my school was not specifically indicted by the whole college admissions scandal a year ago, I can’t help but see some of the privileges wealth can buy in getting ahead in competitive programs, and wonder whether there are some more insidious ways people are helping their children (aside from lying that their kids are on sports teams lol). 

Two of my good friends at this school are pre-med and have extra time accommodations on exams due to test anxiety. Both come from wealthy East Coast families and both are VERY smart (I don’t think they would be at this school if they weren’t!). I am not pre-med so I don’t take the classes a huge portion of the undergraduate population does, but I obviously know and speak with a lot of pre-meds, and word always spreads like wildfire after chemistry tests, and the general consensus is always that they are insanely hard because everything is too rushed and many people don’t finish on time. My two friends, however, have never complained to me of this. At the beginning of the year, before I found out about their accommodations (I only found out because they were in the same class as me second semester and were not present in the exam room with me, so I asked where they were and they explained), I was just really in awe of how they could fly through an exam and get impeccable grades on them. Then after I learned about the accommodations, I found myself thinking “Oh, that explains it”.

My friends don’t seem like very anxious people, but I don’t want to speak too much on that, as I have an general anxiety diagnosis as well and I am fully aware that the face you present to the world does not necessarily correlate with your personal struggles. My issue is that both of my friends are pre-med. Both want to be surgeons. If they cannot complete a chemistry exam within the time given due to the undue stress it puts them under, how are they going to handle surgery, when someone’s very life is at risk? You can’t ask for extra time on that. 

I don’t think that accommodations based on test anxiety should never be allowed. I recognize that there are lots of jobs like engineers, computer scientists, businesspeople, etc. who do not perform their jobs under the same stressful conditions as a timed examination, and can simply work on whatever project they’ve been given at a slower pace, or whatever it may be. My issue is that some professions do not afford this, and so students should not be able to get these accommodations if they are studying to enter one of these professions. The jobs that comes to mind is surgeon/doctor, and a courtroom lawyer. If you cannot operate under stressful conditions, I don’t think you could do these jobs. 

It is because of my own anxiety that I am not pursuing a career in either of these fields, because I understand I am not cut out for these fields. I do not respond well to stress at all, and I know these demanding jobs would be a detriment both to me mentally and to whoever I was trying to help. This is fine, as there are a myriad of other jobs I can have. 

I guess it comes down to the fact that I, as an anxiety sufferer, cannot imagine that someone who gets so anxious while taking a written exam (that one can argue at the end of the day means very little) that they have to have extra time (one has double the time) to do it could even consider a profession where you have to make snap decisions about someone’s life. My friends do better on exams by virtue of the fact that they are no longer rushed and have time to complete and fully think through all the questions, so a part of me wonders whether the accommodation is just another way of keeping GPAs high for medical school. 

To me it feels like a blind person trying to become a surgeon, both have limitations that mean they are not suited for the job at hand. That’s totally okay, they can receive accommodations necessary to perform other jobs. I think that a student should be able to have accommodations for test anxiety or they should be able to pursue a high-stress career, but not both.

,changemyview,"This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele's weight loss *rolls eyes*
It's been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it's because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. 

But let's be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I'll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It's not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? 

Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let's face it. Losing weight sucks and it's really really hard. It's so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that's why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I've seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.

Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I'm trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It's not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. 

And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn't have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as. So if you truly see yourself for how and always as being overweight and you know why the love yourself and good things will come into your life.",t2_5kxee6kc,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: fat shaming isnt about body positivity and the fallout on social media of adele losing weight is a good example of that.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfiffa,FALSE,dark,0.61,,public,6,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,6,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588925275,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele&amp;#39;s weight loss &lt;em&gt;rolls eyes&lt;/em&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it&amp;#39;s because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I&amp;#39;ll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It&amp;#39;s not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let&amp;#39;s face it. Losing weight sucks and it&amp;#39;s really really hard. It&amp;#39;s so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that&amp;#39;s why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I&amp;#39;ve seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I&amp;#39;m trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It&amp;#39;s not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn&amp;#39;t have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as. So if you truly see yourself for how and always as being overweight and you know why the love yourself and good things will come into your life.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"First of all, I am a woman.

I believe that divorce laws in various parts of the world have a very outdated conception of the social role of women. She is seen as unable to generate for the family, since decades ago either women did not work, or the salary was much lower than that of a man, making it impossible to be able to live without depending on a husband. Many divorces favor women more. But times have changed.

And I will be referring to marriages between men and women here, but the logic would also fit into same-sex marriages.

Today, some families have women as their main provider, and there is no equal wage difference like the old times. A working woman is no longer frowned upon. There is no reason why unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement, the division of assets is divided equally, or there are more benefits in divorce for women. I believe that during a divorce, the amount of assets that each will have must equal the financial contribution of each one during the marriage and that should be the only factor to be taken into account.

Yes, I believe that housewives do not deserve to finish anything bought by the husband from a divorce. Psychological support is no longer a valid argument for anyone who is sustained in a society in which everyone can work. It is not just because she will end up with nothing that she deserves something she didn’t work to achieve.

Honestly, I have never heard of a divorce in which the woman ended up at a disadvantage that did not involve a well-written nuptial agreement that protected the man.

And children's pensions should also be reviewed. I believe that there should be a better control of the one who gives the money on the end that it will be destined. All money from these pensions should go to children.

I believe that women and feminism fought hard to reach the equality we enjoy in many parts of the world, and I believe that the way in which divorce is carried out has a vestige of an idea that women should be protected. The advantages we have during divorce must be eradicated to reflect our era.

,changemyview,"**Nihilism**

&gt;**Nihilism** is the point of view that suspends belief in any or all general aspects of human life, which are culturally accepted. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nihilism is useful as a starting point for an intellectual exercise to better understand a cultural concept. It is not, however, a sustainable philosophy to build a society around.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to form a functioning society, there must be an overarching culture that binds people together. This culture must be built from some axioms that can be used to orient that culture's direction of development over time. For example, western liberalism (most of western civilization) is built from the axioms that human life has intrinsic value and the individual is sacred. These are concepts that emerged from the enlightenment and were derived from Judaeo-Christian tradition. It is useful to take a nihilistic approach when analyzing these axioms, to instead question why these assertions are true rather than assuming they are true, but nihilism cannot provide the necessary foundation on which to form a society because it questions the very concept of an axiom. It is not a starting point from which a society can build a culture and orient its development.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hedonism**

&gt;**Hedonism** is a school of thought that argues seeking pleasure and avoiding suffering are the only components of well-being. Ethical hedonism is the view that combines hedonism with welfarist ethics, which claim that what we should do depends exclusively on what affects the well-being individuals have. Ethical hedonists would defend either increasing pleasure and reducing suffering for all beings capable of experiencing them, or just reducing suffering in the case of negative consequentialism. According to negative utilitarianism, only the minimization of suffering would matter. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedonism is unhealthy for a society two ways. The first being directly through the adoption of its tenants into culture, and the second being indirectly through the adoption of its tenants by individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

Directly adopting tenants of  hedonism into a culture poses one large problem: *There is no objective means by which to measure pleasure and suffering.* Firstly this is a logistical issue, if your goal is to reduce suffering, whose suffering takes priority and how is that determination made. You cannot reduce everyone's suffering simultaneously and equally. Secondly, this will inevitably cause conflict. What reduces one person's suffering might increase the suffering of another. What might be pleasurable for one could be suffering for another.

&amp;#x200B;

Individuals adopting hedonism as a personal philosophy also creates problems. In addition to the conflicts mentioned above, on a psychological level, some suffering is required to give life meaning. In he process of overcoming adversity in an attempt to achieve a higher goal, encountering adversity will always lead to some form of suffering. We are aware of this, and subconsciously we crave this adversity, we are always the hero in our own story, when there is no dragon to battle against we create our own to justify ourselves, most recently becoming evident in the concept of *first-world problems*. This idea I feel was best illustrated in Fyodor Dostoyevski's *Notes from the Underground:*

&gt;Even if man were nothing but a piano key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of sheer ingratitude, simply to have his own way…then, after all, perhaps only by his curse will he attain his object, that is, really convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key!

Here goes: I believe that the common issues with our society, for example: climate change, wealth inequality, corruption and racism, stem from the idea that human nature ultimately creates a hierarchical structure in society. Those on ‘top’ (without realising or not) will end up maintaining/asserting their position through oppression and domination of those lower in the hierarchy. 

This structure is unsustainable in the world today because it allows those at the ‘top’ of the hierarchy to consume and hog resources in a way that will ultimately lead to resource depletion and the collapse of society. 

This unsustainability is what has lead to our current environmental crisis. The inequality that it creates fosters racism and hate. Corruption occurs because those at the ‘top’ do not want to lose their positions. There are other issues that exist as a result as well.

The reason I believe we cannot ‘fix’ society is because I think this hierarchical structure is built into our nature, and no matter what we do we will end up returning to this unsustainable society.

Whether or not you believe in implementing communism as a governmental structure / society, the main points of The Communist Manifesto are relevant and hold true today.

You can be a capitalist while criticizing the flaws of capitalism. Whether or not you believe in communist governments, the theory behind communism and Marx's piece is undeniably true today. Some of the strong and relevant points he makes:

\- Capitalism is built on and exploits the working class and encourages class struggle and inequality

\-The bourgeois exploits the proletariat for gaining more capital, while the working class must sell themselves (in some way, whether it's time, health, their safety, etc.) to survive

\-Capitalism is unstable and unsustainable, and the working class will revolt, moving a society from capitalism to socialism and eventually to communism (note: you can disagree with implementing communism in governments, but it's hard to deny that this cycle often happens, where the working class stands up for themselves and wants to slowly transition into a communist practice -- it's happening now in America).

\-The workers will unite and take positions of power, representing the working class

Sites such as Facebook or Twitter are especially good at being a nesting ground for antivaxx, 5g lunatics, big pharma, etc. They keep on spreading their unfounded beliefs to their loyal fanbase. This is where the block user functionality sucks.

See, whenever a party wants to contrast their belief, they are immediately blocked. There is no way of pushing contrasting beliefs into a discussion, as you will just get blocked. This breeds echo-chambers, which are destructive, and lead to only more of conspiracies and idiocracy. Taking into consideration this, the block user function has a negative effect.However, I acknowledge that the function has been designed to help prevent doxxing, as well as insults, stalking and other harmful acts.

I also acknowledge that this was the reason it was designed. However, people abuse the power they have. Hence, I think that the function should be changed because it is used in a way that creates destructive communities and breeds echo-chambers.

A person should have to choose the reason they are blocking someone.

The reason it (In my opinion) should work this way is that there already exists the option to Mute a person on Twitter and Facebook, therefore, if a person does not want to see the comments, they can just mute the person. Nowadays, many users use ""block"" function instead of ""mute"", which means that they basically prevent their point from being contrasted by others (effectively breeding echo chambers).

Edit: I think I need to clarify that this post is about blocking, not muting.

This tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth.

Disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet, but mark my words, there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by Disney to fit their idea of what it should be. 

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way. 

Disney owns too much and has the power to do too much. Let me make another example. Star Wars. I know, I know, “TLJ sucked, not canon! Duurrrrr!” I’m not here to bash the movies. I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that!

I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. 

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

,changemyview,"Pretty much the title.

Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a 'Glow up'. I think this kind of attitude is just thinly veiled bitterness and jealousy that someone has acheived something fantastic that they are happy with and proud of.

Adele was always a great singer and performer and arguably pretty too but she looks amazing now and very happy and if people are congratulating her I think it's wonderful. The mental gymnastics of people that are suggesting she might have depression, a drug addiction or even cancer is just a pathetic attempt at finding excuses for why she was able to do something that others can't. And it's all false too because she has been very open for YEARS about wanting to lose weight for various reasons. She cut out sugar in her tea (true brit), hired a trainer and a nutritionist etc, she worked really really hard and its just sad people that can't be happy for her.

This kind of tweet and retweet is what I mean:  [https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454](https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454)

The first guy saying some stupid shit about her looking like a sorority girl about to marry into old money doesn't even make fucking sense, but the retweet is just as bad saying that people like fat people getting thin (and healthier) too much. The woman retweeting is extremely fat and openly trying to use that to make herself a model so she has a vested interest in being obese not being seen as the negative thing that it is.

I also think it is disingenous to suggest this isn't a 'glow up'. What is the actual definition? From what I've seen it's literally just pictures of people age 15-18 or something then them in their 20s all done up with makeup. The whole idea of a 'glow up' is already vapid and shallow and suggesting Adele's doesn't count when it looks more like it than most others just shows the disingenuous nature of these people's attitude.

Anyway, CMV?

Insinuating that this hasn't been some kind of cultural debate is just intellectually dishonest.",t2_qeb1e,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: People upset about Adele being praised for her recent weight-loss are just jealous and bitter,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gf3pqa,FALSE,dark,0.73,,public,32,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,32,,FALSE,,1588850166,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588874303,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a &amp;#39;Glow up&amp;#39;. I think this kind of attitude is just thinly veiled bitterness and jealousy that someone has acheived something fantastic that they are happy with and proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adele was always a great singer and performer and arguably pretty too but she looks amazing now and very happy and if people are congratulating her I think it&amp;#39;s wonderful. The mental gymnastics of people that are suggesting she might have depression, a drug addiction or even cancer is just a pathetic attempt at finding excuses for why she was able to do something that others can&amp;#39;t. And it&amp;#39;s all false too because she has been very open for YEARS about wanting to lose weight for various reasons. She cut out sugar in her tea (true brit), hired a trainer and a nutritionist etc, she worked really really hard and its just sad people that can&amp;#39;t be happy for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of tweet and retweet is what I mean:  &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454""&gt;https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first guy saying some stupid shit about her looking like a sorority girl about to marry into old money doesn&amp;#39;t even make fucking sense, but the retweet is just as bad saying that people like fat people getting thin (and healthier) too much. The woman retweeting is extremely fat and openly trying to use that to make herself a model so she has a vested interest in being obese not being seen as the negative thing that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think it is disingenous to suggest this isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;#39;glow up&amp;#39;. What is the actual definition? From what I&amp;#39;ve seen it&amp;#39;s literally just pictures of people age 15-18 or something then them in their 20s all done up with makeup. The whole idea of a &amp;#39;glow up&amp;#39; is already vapid and shallow and suggesting Adele&amp;#39;s doesn&amp;#39;t count when it looks more like it than most others just shows the disingenuous nature of these people&amp;#39;s attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, CMV?&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/) by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health. There are sometimes seem as a newer drug epidemic set to spar off with the opioid epidemic for it's debilitating effects on public health. 

Benzodiazapines are a class of minor tranquilizer/sedative drugs that are less potent than their older, less safe equivalent barbiturates. They act positive allostatic modulators of the GABA-subtype A receptor and it's various subtypes of binding cites. By pulling in an influx of negatively charged chloride ions, they inhibit the firing of a neuron, thereby decreasing brain activity globally. Alcohol works as a GABA agonist as well, and also antagonizes the common excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, from which GABA is synthesized. 

GABA says ""stop"", glutamate says ""go"". This will be an important dichotomy to bear in mind. Currently, benzodiazapines like Vallium (diazapam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Atavian (lorazepam) are classified under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as Schedule IV class drugs. By being a controlled substance, a drug's availability becomes subject to extra legislation that non-scheduled drugs are not. For instance, refills on classes III-V expire after six months from the time they are written, which is normally a year for unscheduled drugs. Schedule II drugs require a new prescription every refill, and cannot have automatic refills attached to them. Meaning your doctor must write a new one each month. Also in the case of Schedule II, no more than a 30 day supple of the drug can be prescribed on one prescription. Which means if you take it once a day, you get 30 max. Penalties for illegal possession are also higher.  

So, my case is that benzodiazapines, as well as the non-benzodiazapine hypnotic ""Z-drugs"" such as Ambien and Lunesta, should be reclassified from Schedule IV to Schedule II. My argument for this is that benzodiazapines are addictive, highly abusable, and deadly. Withdrawal can last months, if not years. Longer than opioid withdrawal by a country mile. Abuse and chronic use of Benzodiazapines can cause tolerance to build, resulting in the uncoupling and down-regulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation or increased genetic expression of NMDA receptors, the brain's main glutamate receptor. This creates excito-toxicity in the brain that can cause apoptosis (neuron cell death, often permanent in most areas of the brain), long term structural and functional disturbances, and most famous of all, seizures! None of that is pleasant. 

Now you might be thinking ""Well hang on, by adding extra regulations, couldn't that get many people taken off their medication?"" 

Yes, it might. But the few conditions benzodiazapines are FDA approved to treat (insomnia, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and epilepsy) are finding new and alternative treatments. Anxiety disorders have antidepressants, BuSpar, or just plain old exercise. Insomnia has antihistamines (including prescription ones), exercise, and improvements in sleep hygiene. The only disorders I stand by giving benzodiazapines to as a first line treatment is for panic disorder and epilepsy. Those conditions benefit far more from chronic treatment than does anxiety and sleep disorders, both of which have plenty of alternative treatment options. 

The dangers and risks of benzodiazapines are pretty apparent, so I advise you not disregard those factors when trying to change my view. Also, as I see a lot in drug-related debates, deflecting to another drug or issue is not a valid argument in my eyes. Yes, opioids are currently more deadly. That does not reduce the harms benzodiazapines are causing.",t2_168wyr,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: Benzodiazapines should be rescheduled under the Controlled Substances Act from Schedule IV to Schedule II,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfktfh,FALSE,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,0,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588934418,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/""&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health.

,changemyview,"I will start by saying that I am not religious, and that this is a religious topic (didn't want to put the ""fired up"" religious wording in the title, in an effort to keep this discussion civil).

I am specifically referring to the fact that Jewish people are not allowed to do anything that can be considered ""work"" outside their home on a Saturday. This includes carrying objects. In order to get around this, in Manhattan, there is a wire strung around a whole bunch of light poles up off the ground enclosing a large portion of the island, such that people can say ""I am within the wire, so I am *teeeechnically* indoors, so I can carry stuff.""

I don't understand the point in imposing upon yourself this rule (and I do think it's imposed upon yourself rather than imposed upon you by your religion - you can choose not to be Jewish, or choose to ignore parts of the religion you don't agree with. Nobody is holding you at gunpoint), if you're going to break it. I can understand someone wanting to have the rule if that's what they want. I can also understand someone wanting to not have the rule. But I don't understand what the benefit is in saying ""I am going to follow the rule, but when I don't want to follow the rule, I'm going to stretch definitions such that I am now allowed to break the rule without actually breaking it"". Again, I'm not religious, but I don't think you're supposed to circumvent God like this by finding your own way to make yourself compliant. Presumably God has the ability to interpret things and would be able to say ""Oh, come on now, that doesn't count"".

I'm getting a bit into the weeds, but my point is that I don't see the purpose in trying to circumvent your own rule. It seems silly. CMV.

,changemyview,"Do I think fat people should be shamed for the extra weight they carry? No. Do I think they should be praised for carrying it proudly? No

By promoting body positivity we're telling people essentially that any body type is okay. And while I'm not saying we should all be athletic gods and goddesses, no one should be happy with or encouraged to be proud of their overweight.

Obese people die sooner and have worse health complications. By telling young, impressionable people that their bodies are perfect just the way they are, we are promoting children to develop bad eating and exercise habits because we lie and tell them that their body is beautiful.

Body neutrality is better because it should be okay to hate parts of your body and want to change them. As I said, fat people shouldn't be shamed because of their lack of health. But honestly, obesity is gross, unhealthy, and leads to things like a higher chance of heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cancer, etc. 

Body positivity doesn't promote a healthy person as a whole. While it may \*superficially \*help their mental health it doesn't benefit their physical health which is equally important.

Edit: sorry I came here to try and learn from a good argument. So many people are downvoting my comments. I honestly don't care do as you want. But I'm unsure if that's the best option when an opinion doesn't work with yours

Edit 2: if you're going to put down well people with [very specific condition] can't help but be fat that still isn't an argument for body positivity imo but you'll comment anyways so what do I care

Edit 3: this is becoming a lot for now. It's almost 3 a.m. where I'm at I'll check back in on this in the morning. Lots of people getting really fired up. I cane here for a good argument to help change my view not to be internet yelled at lol. But again, what the hell do I care what y'all do

Edit 4: Wow okay before you comment let me just put up some common misconceptions. I am not saying that we should tell fat people that they are gross straight up to their face. I'm saying as a society we shouldn't promote unhealthy body types. If you're here to say something off topic I'm really not interested in responding. By the kill themselves content in the title in referring to the onslaught of health conditions. I do not care about the time you bribe your leg and gained 20 pounds for 6 months. All I think is that as a society we should printer healthy lifestyle choices

Edit 5: I am open to changing my view and two arguments have struck some change in me. But I'm not fully convinced. I've mentioned in multiple comments that I understand my view is viewed as toxic by many but I dunt have anything compelling to change it

Edit 6: at this point in time people are commenting just to comment and it's getting really off topic. I'm not sure what my sexuality has to do with anything.

First off. I'll say that it's okay to not like a comic, or to not like it's story or characters or message/moral. That's an opinion and it's okay to have one. Simply saying politics should stay out of comics is not valid. I'm not saying every comic needs or even has a political message, some are just dumb fun.

However, throughout the publication history of comics there have been many cases in which the writer/creator injects topical and political elements into the stories. From the very creation of the superhero genre, politics has been part of the story. Superman, the first superhero, is an illegal alien created by two Jewish guys in the 1930s.

People only complain because they don't like the message. The same people complaining that Iceman is gay now are totally fine with the X-men as a whole. The X-men were an obvious allegory for race relations when they were created and now are compared with LGBT rights.

Essentially; politics are, always have been, and should continue to be a part or comics. Those who complain about it only disagree with the specific message.

Ok so I am very much hoping that someone on here can really change my view because I do feel awful saying this, but it’s been something on my mind. So here’s where I’m at:

I go to one of the top universities in the US, and our undergraduate program is heavily dominated by pre-med folk. Because it’s an elite university, there are a good chunk of students from wealthy families here. While my school was not specifically indicted by the whole college admissions scandal a year ago, I can’t help but see some of the privileges wealth can buy in getting ahead in competitive programs, and wonder whether there are some more insidious ways people are helping their children (aside from lying that their kids are on sports teams lol). 

Two of my good friends at this school are pre-med and have extra time accommodations on exams due to test anxiety. Both come from wealthy East Coast families and both are VERY smart (I don’t think they would be at this school if they weren’t!). I am not pre-med so I don’t take the classes a huge portion of the undergraduate population does, but I obviously know and speak with a lot of pre-meds, and word always spreads like wildfire after chemistry tests, and the general consensus is always that they are insanely hard because everything is too rushed and many people don’t finish on time. My two friends, however, have never complained to me of this. At the beginning of the year, before I found out about their accommodations (I only found out because they were in the same class as me second semester and were not present in the exam room with me, so I asked where they were and they explained), I was just really in awe of how they could fly through an exam and get impeccable grades on them. Then after I learned about the accommodations, I found myself thinking “Oh, that explains it”.

My friends don’t seem like very anxious people, but I don’t want to speak too much on that, as I have an general anxiety diagnosis as well and I am fully aware that the face you present to the world does not necessarily correlate with your personal struggles. My issue is that both of my friends are pre-med. Both want to be surgeons. If they cannot complete a chemistry exam within the time given due to the undue stress it puts them under, how are they going to handle surgery, when someone’s very life is at risk? You can’t ask for extra time on that. 

I don’t think that accommodations based on test anxiety should never be allowed. I recognize that there are lots of jobs like engineers, computer scientists, businesspeople, etc. who do not perform their jobs under the same stressful conditions as a timed examination, and can simply work on whatever project they’ve been given at a slower pace, or whatever it may be. My issue is that some professions do not afford this, and so students should not be able to get these accommodations if they are studying to enter one of these professions. The jobs that comes to mind is surgeon/doctor, and a courtroom lawyer. If you cannot operate under stressful conditions, I don’t think you could do these jobs. 

It is because of my own anxiety that I am not pursuing a career in either of these fields, because I understand I am not cut out for these fields. I do not respond well to stress at all, and I know these demanding jobs would be a detriment both to me mentally and to whoever I was trying to help. This is fine, as there are a myriad of other jobs I can have. 

I guess it comes down to the fact that I, as an anxiety sufferer, cannot imagine that someone who gets so anxious while taking a written exam (that one can argue at the end of the day means very little) that they have to have extra time (one has double the time) to do it could even consider a profession where you have to make snap decisions about someone’s life. My friends do better on exams by virtue of the fact that they are no longer rushed and have time to complete and fully think through all the questions, so a part of me wonders whether the accommodation is just another way of keeping GPAs high for medical school. 

To me it feels like a blind person trying to become a surgeon, both have limitations that mean they are not suited for the job at hand. That’s totally okay, they can receive accommodations necessary to perform other jobs. I think that a student should be able to have accommodations for test anxiety or they should be able to pursue a high-stress career, but not both.

So here’s where I’m at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to one of the top universities in the US, and our undergraduate program is heavily dominated by pre-med folk. Because it’s an elite university, there are a good chunk of students from wealthy families here. While my school was not specifically indicted by the whole college admissions scandal a year ago, I can’t help but see some of the privileges wealth can buy in getting ahead in competitive programs, and wonder whether there are some more insidious ways people are helping their children (aside from lying that their kids are on sports teams lol). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of my good friends at this school are pre-med and have extra time accommodations on exams due to test anxiety. Both come from wealthy East Coast families and both are VERY smart (I don’t think they would be at this school if they weren’t!). I am not pre-med so I don’t take the classes a huge portion of the undergraduate population does, but I obviously know and speak with a lot of pre-meds, and word always spreads like wildfire after chemistry tests, and the general consensus is always that they are insanely hard because everything is too rushed and many people don’t finish on time. My two friends, however, have never complained to me of this. At the beginning of the year, before I found out about their accommodations (I only found out because they were in the same class as me second semester and were not present in the exam room with me, so I asked where they were and they explained), I was just really in awe of how they could fly through an exam and get impeccable grades on them. Then after I learned about the accommodations, I found myself thinking “Oh, that explains it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends don’t seem like very anxious people, but I don’t want to speak too much on that, as I have an general anxiety diagnosis as well and I am fully aware that the face you present to the world does not necessarily correlate with your personal struggles. My issue is that both of my friends are pre-med. Both want to be surgeons. If they cannot complete a chemistry exam within the time given due to the undue stress it puts them under, how are they going to handle surgery, when someone’s very life is at risk? You can’t ask for extra time on that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that accommodations based on test anxiety should never be allowed. I recognize that there are lots of jobs like engineers, computer scientists, businesspeople, etc. who do not perform their jobs under the same stressful conditions as a timed examination, and can simply work on whatever project they’ve been given at a slower pace, or whatever it may be. My issue is that some professions do not afford this, and so students should not be able to get these accommodations if they are studying to enter one of these professions. The jobs that comes to mind is surgeon/doctor, and a courtroom lawyer. If you cannot operate under stressful conditions, I don’t think you could do these jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele's weight loss *rolls eyes*
It's been a while since the topic of fat shaming came up and I believe it's because people have kind of accepted it for what it is which is bullying. Even in some cases where your fat shamed for being unhealthy it is sometimes still bullying. That carrys from your choice of words and the tone of your voice etc. That makes it percieved as bullying and many people have become so hyper sensitive to it that any discussion about weight immediately becomes an accusation of shaming. 

But let's be clear: being overweight is not sexy. Sure some people can dress it up and pull it off but it almost always is paired with an unparalleled level of confidence and by itself being overweight is not attractive whatsoever. The reasons exclusively have to do with your health. The complications that come with being overweight affects everything from from your cardiovascular system to your regular organ function to more complicated conditions like diabetes and makes you more susceptible to strokes or heart attacks. I'll gloss alot of the medical information because like, theres alot. It's not attractive because we know as a human species that those types of conditions have a higher potential to make a person a burden and unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I say that because sure your heart and mind might be in the right place with unrelinquishable amount of love and knowledge but if you cant make your body follow? 

Anyways to the point. Adele did it. She lost a bunch of weight. Shes eating healthier and living a better lifestyle. Congratulations to her. Frick yeah shes a boss and a great role model. So many people struggle to do what she just did because let's face it. Losing weight sucks and it's really really hard. It's so much more than running 5k and eating your veggies. And I think that's why so many people are butt hurt about it. She did what alot of people are struggling to do. By redirecting attention to how she used to be it will continue to give the movement credibility even though not one person I've seen or heard anywhere in my community or on social media has said anything negative. Remember what fat shaming was? Bullying. And I believe that congratulating someone on such a huge accomplishment is the opposite of bullying. Its empowerment. TRUE EMPOWERMENT. Do the hard thing. Get results. Get rrecognized. Be a role model.

Look this isnt a rant against being overweight. I'm trying to do it myself so I know its rediculously hard sometimes its demoralizing. But weve really got to look beyond the shallow and really try and improve all areas of our life. The fat shaming movement needs to be seen for what it is. It's not empowerment its enabling. Seek empowerment. Do the hard thing and dont enable others or yourself. Talk it out and have a real conversation to see if your really comfortable being overweight or if your just afraid to change or if you honestly just dont know how or where to start. 

And finally to say goodbye I just want to say one last thing: just because your overweight doesnt make you a bad person. You shouldn't have to put up with true bullying. You deserve dignity and the power to be who you see yourself as. So if you truly see yourself for how and always as being overweight and you know why the love yourself and good things will come into your life.",t2_5kxee6kc,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: fat shaming isnt about body positivity and the fallout on social media of adele losing weight is a good example of that.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gfiffa,FALSE,dark,0.63,,public,8,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,8,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588925275,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to some of the clashing going on due to adele&amp;#39;s weight loss &lt;em&gt;rolls eyes&lt;/em&gt;

,changemyview,"First of all, I am a woman.

I believe that divorce laws in various parts of the world have a very outdated conception of the social role of women. She is seen as unable to generate for the family, since decades ago either women did not work, or the salary was much lower than that of a man, making it impossible to be able to live without depending on a husband. Many divorces favor women more. But times have changed.

And I will be referring to marriages between men and women here, but the logic would also fit into same-sex marriages.

Today, some families have women as their main provider, and there is no equal wage difference like the old times. A working woman is no longer frowned upon. There is no reason why unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement, the division of assets is divided equally, or there are more benefits in divorce for women. I believe that during a divorce, the amount of assets that each will have must equal the financial contribution of each one during the marriage and that should be the only factor to be taken into account.

Yes, I believe that housewives do not deserve to finish anything bought by the husband from a divorce. Psychological support is no longer a valid argument for anyone who is sustained in a society in which everyone can work. It is not just because she will end up with nothing that she deserves something she didn’t work to achieve.

Honestly, I have never heard of a divorce in which the woman ended up at a disadvantage that did not involve a well-written nuptial agreement that protected the man.

And children's pensions should also be reviewed. I believe that there should be a better control of the one who gives the money on the end that it will be destined. All money from these pensions should go to children.

I believe that women and feminism fought hard to reach the equality we enjoy in many parts of the world, and I believe that the way in which divorce is carried out has a vestige of an idea that women should be protected. The advantages we have during divorce must be eradicated to reflect our era.

&gt;**Nihilism** is the point of view that suspends belief in any or all general aspects of human life, which are culturally accepted. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nihilism is useful as a starting point for an intellectual exercise to better understand a cultural concept. It is not, however, a sustainable philosophy to build a society around.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to form a functioning society, there must be an overarching culture that binds people together. This culture must be built from some axioms that can be used to orient that culture's direction of development over time. For example, western liberalism (most of western civilization) is built from the axioms that human life has intrinsic value and the individual is sacred. These are concepts that emerged from the enlightenment and were derived from Judaeo-Christian tradition. It is useful to take a nihilistic approach when analyzing these axioms, to instead question why these assertions are true rather than assuming they are true, but nihilism cannot provide the necessary foundation on which to form a society because it questions the very concept of an axiom. It is not a starting point from which a society can build a culture and orient its development.

**Hedonism**

&gt;**Hedonism** is a school of thought that argues seeking pleasure and avoiding suffering are the only components of well-being. Ethical hedonism is the view that combines hedonism with welfarist ethics, which claim that what we should do depends exclusively on what affects the well-being individuals have. Ethical hedonists would defend either increasing pleasure and reducing suffering for all beings capable of experiencing them, or just reducing suffering in the case of negative consequentialism. According to negative utilitarianism, only the minimization of suffering would matter. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedonism is unhealthy for a society two ways. The first being directly through the adoption of its tenants into culture, and the second being indirectly through the adoption of its tenants by individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

Directly adopting tenants of  hedonism into a culture poses one large problem: *There is no objective means by which to measure pleasure and suffering.* Firstly this is a logistical issue, if your goal is to reduce suffering, whose suffering takes priority and how is that determination made. You cannot reduce everyone's suffering simultaneously and equally. Secondly, this will inevitably cause conflict. What reduces one person's suffering might increase the suffering of another. What might be pleasurable for one could be suffering for another.

&amp;#x200B;

Individuals adopting hedonism as a personal philosophy also creates problems. In addition to the conflicts mentioned above, on a psychological level, some suffering is required to give life meaning. In he process of overcoming adversity in an attempt to achieve a higher goal, encountering adversity will always lead to some form of suffering. We are aware of this, and subconsciously we crave this adversity, we are always the hero in our own story, when there is no dragon to battle against we create our own to justify ourselves, most recently becoming evident in the concept of *first-world problems*. This idea I feel was best illustrated in Fyodor Dostoyevski's *Notes from the Underground:*

&gt;Even if man were nothing but a piano key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of sheer ingratitude, simply to have his own way…then, after all, perhaps only by his curse will he attain his object, that is, really convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key!

Here goes: I believe that the common issues with our society, for example: climate change, wealth inequality, corruption and racism, stem from the idea that human nature ultimately creates a hierarchical structure in society.

This structure is unsustainable in the world today because it allows those at the ‘top’ of the hierarchy to consume and hog resources in a way that will ultimately lead to resource depletion and the collapse of society. 

This unsustainability is what has lead to our current environmental crisis. The inequality that it creates fosters racism and hate. Corruption occurs because those at the ‘top’ do not want to lose their positions. There are other issues that exist as a result as well.

The reason I believe we cannot ‘fix’ society is because I think this hierarchical structure is built into our nature, and no matter what we do we will end up returning to this unsustainable society.

You can be a capitalist while criticizing the flaws of capitalism. Whether or not you believe in communist governments, the theory behind communism and Marx's piece is undeniably true today. Some of the strong and relevant points he makes:

\- Capitalism is built on and exploits the working class and encourages class struggle and inequality

\-The bourgeois exploits the proletariat for gaining more capital, while the working class must sell themselves (in some way, whether it's time, health, their safety, etc.) to survive

\-Capitalism is unstable and unsustainable, and the working class will revolt, moving a society from capitalism to socialism and eventually to communism (note: you can disagree with implementing communism in governments, but it's hard to deny that this cycle often happens, where the working class stands up for themselves and wants to slowly transition into a communist practice -- it's happening now in America).

\-The workers will unite and take positions of power, representing the working class

Sites such as Facebook or Twitter are especially good at being a nesting ground for antivaxx, 5g lunatics, big pharma, etc. They keep on spreading their unfounded beliefs to their loyal fanbase. This is where the block user functionality sucks.

See, whenever a party wants to contrast their belief, they are immediately blocked. There is no way of pushing contrasting beliefs into a discussion, as you will just get blocked. This breeds echo-chambers, which are destructive, and lead to only more of conspiracies and idiocracy.

I also acknowledge that this was the reason it was designed. However, people abuse the power they have.

Here is how I envision the change, however, this is obviously a matter that should be analyzed and considered by many, not a sole redditor. A person should have to choose the reason they are blocking someone.

The user would then be blocked immediately, however, the claim would then be checked by a human supervisor, similarly to how it works with reports. Of course, all of these are matter to discussion. The reason it (In my opinion) should work this way is that there already exists the option to Mute a person on Twitter and Facebook, therefore, if a person does not want to see the comments, they can just mute the person. Nowadays, many users use ""block"" function instead of ""mute"", which means that they basically prevent their point from being contrasted by others (effectively breeding echo chambers).

Edit: I think I need to clarify that this post is about blocking, not muting.

This tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth. Controlling media and entertainment is how you control a culture or the way it thinks and acts. Disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet, but mark my words, there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by Disney to fit their idea of what it should be. 

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way. 

Disney owns too much and has the power to do too much. Let me make another example. Star Wars. I know, I know, “TLJ sucked, not canon! Duurrrrr!” I’m not here to bash the movies. I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that! Star Wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed, the rest could have done whatever it wanted! Here’s another one, Star Wars: Battlefront II the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco (gambling in games that kids can access). I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. 

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

Edit: After reading through some of your comments, I think it’s necessary to clarify a few things.

I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that! Star Wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed, the rest could have done whatever it wanted! Here’s another one, Star Wars: Battlefront II the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco (gambling in games that kids can access). I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: After reading through some of your comments, I think it’s necessary to clarify a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I’m not an economist and my knowledge of this topic has been broadened immensely from just hearing what some of you had to say, so thank you for enlightening a dull individual such as myself. It has changed my view in some areas of this discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Comcast is NOT owned by Disney, I misread that detail when doing a quick research. I’m sorry for mixing that up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) My terminology is not entirely accurate since I’m not as privy to the business side. But the spirit of the post is still intact and is directed at Disney having the control and influence over media and the ability to possibly censor or influence future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

Adele has recent lost a tremendous amount of weight and posted a picture of herself looking slim, beautiful and most of all happy at her recent birthday celebration. Of course most people were understandably happy and proud of her achievement! However, there is a subset of people (mostly very fat women) who are upset that she is being praised for her weight loss. They say it is fatphobic, reinforcing negative stereotypes about body image and not an example of a 'Glow up'. I think this kind of attitude is just thinly veiled bitterness and jealousy that someone has acheived something fantastic that they are happy with and proud of.

Adele was always a great singer and performer and arguably pretty too but she looks amazing now and very happy and if people are congratulating her I think it's wonderful. The mental gymnastics of people that are suggesting she might have depression, a drug addiction or even cancer is just a pathetic attempt at finding excuses for why she was able to do something that others can't. And it's all false too because she has been very open for YEARS about wanting to lose weight for various reasons. She cut out sugar in her tea (true brit), hired a trainer and a nutritionist etc, she worked really really hard and its just sad people that can't be happy for her.

This kind of tweet and retweet is what I mean:  [https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454](https://twitter.com/JusticeTierney/status/1257923213016936454)

The first guy saying some stupid shit about her looking like a sorority girl about to marry into old money doesn't even make fucking sense, but the retweet is just as bad saying that people like fat people getting thin (and healthier) too much. The woman retweeting is extremely fat and openly trying to use that to make herself a model so she has a vested interest in being obese not being seen as the negative thing that it is.

I also think it is disingenous to suggest this isn't a 'glow up'. What is the actual definition? From what I've seen it's literally just pictures of people age 15-18 or something then them in their 20s all done up with makeup. The whole idea of a 'glow up' is already vapid and shallow and suggesting Adele's doesn't count when it looks more like it than most others just shows the disingenuous nature of these people's attitude.

,changemyview,"[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/18/prescription-drug-epidemic-no-ones-talking-about/) by the Washington Post highlights the growing issue benzodiazapines are having on public health. There are sometimes seem as a newer drug epidemic set to spar off with the opioid epidemic for it's debilitating effects on public health. 

Benzodiazapines are a class of minor tranquilizer/sedative drugs that are less potent than their older, less safe equivalent barbiturates. They act positive allostatic modulators of the GABA-subtype A receptor and it's various subtypes of binding cites. By pulling in an influx of negatively charged chloride ions, they inhibit the firing of a neuron, thereby decreasing brain activity globally. Alcohol works as a GABA agonist as well, and also antagonizes the common excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, from which GABA is synthesized. 

GABA says ""stop"", glutamate says ""go"". This will be an important dichotomy to bear in mind. Currently, benzodiazapines like Vallium (diazapam), Xanax (alprazolam), and Atavian (lorazepam) are classified under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as Schedule IV class drugs. By being a controlled substance, a drug's availability becomes subject to extra legislation that non-scheduled drugs are not. For instance, refills on classes III-V expire after six months from the time they are written, which is normally a year for unscheduled drugs. Schedule II drugs require a new prescription every refill, and cannot have automatic refills attached to them. Meaning your doctor must write a new one each month. Also in the case of Schedule II, no more than a 30 day supple of the drug can be prescribed on one prescription. Which means if you take it once a day, you get 30 max. Penalties for illegal possession are also higher.  

So, my case is that benzodiazapines, as well as the non-benzodiazapine hypnotic ""Z-drugs"" such as Ambien and Lunesta, should be reclassified from Schedule IV to Schedule II. My argument for this is that benzodiazapines are addictive, highly abusable, and deadly. Withdrawal can last months, if not years. Longer than opioid withdrawal by a country mile. Abuse and chronic use of Benzodiazapines can cause tolerance to build, resulting in the uncoupling and down-regulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation or increased genetic expression of NMDA receptors, the brain's main glutamate receptor. This creates excito-toxicity in the brain that can cause apoptosis (neuron cell death, often permanent in most areas of the brain), long term structural and functional disturbances, and most famous of all, seizures! None of that is pleasant. 

Now you might be thinking ""Well hang on, by adding extra regulations, couldn't that get many people taken off their medication?"" 

Yes, it might. But the few conditions benzodiazapines are FDA approved to treat (insomnia, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and epilepsy) are finding new and alternative treatments. Anxiety disorders have antidepressants, BuSpar, or just plain old exercise. Insomnia has antihistamines (including prescription ones), exercise, and improvements in sleep hygiene. The only disorders I stand by giving benzodiazapines to as a first line treatment is for panic disorder and epilepsy. Those conditions benefit far more from chronic treatment than does anxiety and sleep disorders, both of which have plenty of alternative treatment options. 

The dangers and risks of benzodiazapines are pretty apparent, so I advise you not disregard those factors when trying to change my view. Also, as I see a lot in drug-related debates, deflecting to another drug or issue is not a valid argument in my eyes. Yes, opioids are currently more deadly.

,changemyview,"The subreddit ""antiwork"" and associated ideologies are increasingly popular on reddit, anecdotally. By this I just mean, that subreddit has popped up on /r/all a few times, sometimes with very popular submissions. The majority of the content seems centered around perceived hypocrisies of capitalism, specifically as it pertains to equality, economic justice, etc...but the underlying philosophy of the subreddit seems to be:

1. People should not have to do work to live
2. People have a right to put effort only into what they *want* to be doing
3. Being ""forced"" to do anything other than what you *want* to be doing is simply exploitation of the working class to facilitate the wealthy being able to do what they *want* to be doing instead.

Now, for starters, I agree broadly that our current economic system, especially in the United States, has appalling lapses in economic justice. I think we're in the midst of a second gilded age, where wealth is increasingly concentrated at the top while lower- and middle-class wages struggle to keep up with cost of living increases. I'm broadly supportive of economic justice plans, including some iterations of universal basic income, or a negative income tax. I do not think your employment status should decide whether or not you live in basic dignity.

But work is still necessary.

This is because entropy exists.

In our universe, order tends to disorder. To decay. To rot.

Organisms, as evolved through Darwinian evolution, exist as a means of harnessing sunlight, directly or indirectly, to work against entropy. The primary goal of an organism's genes is to replicate themselves. They build bodies around themselves to navigate the world, entropy and all, to find a means of replicating themselves.

This means constantly fighting against entropy, because without fighting entropy and using energy to build up order, our bodies fall apart. This is what happens to dead bodies, and it's what would happen to a living body if it stopped doing ""work"" - that is to say, consuming and burning calories to fight entropy.

You might think: ""But that's a totally different definition of 'work' - that's not what antiwork is about - antiwork is about not having to work a *job.* It's not about not having to feed yourself and stuff.""

To me, there is almost no distinction.

For example, let's say I had no job and instead just lived off the land.

I would still have to work, quite damn hard, to produce food for myself off the land. Tilling the earth, sowing the seeds, fighting back pests, etc...all of this is ""work"" in a very real sense.

Let's say I'm much better at fighting back pests than I am at sowing seeds, but my neighbor is the opposite.

It would be a lot easier for both of us if I just fought back pests from *both* of our lands, and she sowed seeds on *both* of our lands. Because she's better at sowing seeds, it would take her less time to do both of our fields than it would take me to do mine and her to do hers. Likewise for me fighting back pests. By cooperating with each other, we cut back the effort needed to do the same work.

Now imagine if instead of her sowing seeds on my land, she gives me an I.O.U. that says ""I owe you sowed seeds for one harvest."" Then, she goes into town with some of her extra food and says to someone in town ""I will give you this extra food if you go sow my neighbor's seeds for him for the next harvest."" Then, instead of using my I.O.U. on my neighbor, I use it on that town resident who comes and sows my seeds.

This is essentially the basis for how money works.

When this system gets sufficiently complex, people are able to specialize more and more. To the point where you can enter an agreement to do one very specific thing in a very focused way, on behalf of a bunch of other people, and in return you get an equivalent amount of generalized I.O.U.s.

This is what a job is, in the modern era.

But the ""anti-work"" mindset forgets this. It relies on people losing sight of that fact behind many layers of abstraction, to the point that they forget that work is still fundamentally necessary to eat.

Even under a strict socialist or capitalist system, you still need a mechanism to organize labor to be productive enough to sustain the population. Even without the I.O.U. system, if instead you just rely on an authority directing the whole system (command and control economy) rather than an informal network of agreements, that doesn't change the fundamental fact that *work* is required to fight entropy.",t2_cr0ph,FALSE,,0,FALSE,"CMV: The philosophy behind ""anti-work"", an increasingly popular idea among anti-capitalists on Reddit, is fundamentally based on ignorance of how entropy works.",[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gese9b,FALSE,dark,0.69,,public,82,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,82,,TRUE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588827377,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subreddit &amp;quot;antiwork&amp;quot; and associated ideologies are increasingly popular on reddit, anecdotally.

Secondly, how can you dictate what I do or don't decide to DM someone about? Weird.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if I post a question, and someone starts dming me, it&amp;#39;s my responsibility to block them if I&amp;#39;m getting trolled, or do further research on my own if I&amp;#39;m not sure that I&amp;#39;m getting trolled. It&amp;#39;s not the mods of &lt;a href=""/r/legaladvice""&gt;r/legaladvice&lt;/a&gt; job to police reddits DM&amp;#39;s. However they seem to think so, and have, in a recent post, told someone to tell them the names of those DMing a poster so that they can punish them for breaking the rule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously? Get out of there with that. What a joke. &lt;/p&gt;

In DOJ's motion to drop the charges, they set forth the factual background of the Flynn charges.  In a nutshell, Flynn had been the subject of an investigation into potential improper ties with foreign governments.  That investigation was on the verge of being closed - so close, in fact, that the closing memo had already been written, with the conclusion that there was no evidence that Flynn had committed any crime.  But around that time, there was smoke starting to swirl regarding Trump's - not Flynn's - potential collusion with Russia.  Peter Sztrok, the same FBI official who would later be dropped from Mueller's investigation team because of his text messages in which he and his mistress, Lisa Page, expressed the perception of themselves as America's last hope to avoid a Trump presidency, directed FBI personnel to keep the Flynn investigation open.  DOJ was apparently opposed to further inquiry at the time, because as far as they were concerned, there was no reason to believe Flynn had done anything wrong.  Meanwhile, Flynn, who had been named Trump's national security advisor, but had not come into office yet because Trump was not in office yet, conducted calls with foreign officials.  This is apparently common practice - the next president has been elected, and his cabinet begin getting themselves up to speed and begin building relationships with their counterparts in other countries.  However, it also may be a technical violation of the Logan Act, an obscure law that makes it a felony for private citizens to engage in ""diplomacy"" with hostile foreign national.  How obscure is the Logan Act?  It is 200 years old, was passed in the wake of some thorny negotiations during the John Adams administration, and has been the basis for a total of zero convictions in its history.  If someone were convicted, they would be subject to ""a fine"" or up to three years in prison.

Now, the following dots are not (I don't think) in the motion to dismiss, but are easy enough to connect.  The FBI knew that Flynn had a call with Sergei Kislyak, a Russian diplomat.  The FBI had a recording of the call.  On the call, Flynn had discussed in passing certain sanctions that were in place against Russia.  Technically, this could have been a violation of the Logan Act, which no prosecutor in their right mind would prosecute under these circumstances.  Although the FBI knew what the call was about, they decided that the open investigation into entirely different conduct warranted further inquiry into this call, and determined to have a ""friendly"" interview with Flynn.  By relying on the already-open investigation, they avoided the necessity to justify an investigation based on the very flimsy phone call.  They also conveniently neglected to tell DOJ they were continuing to investigate, because they knew DOJ would not agree to the interview without additional justification.  

In preparation for the interview, an FBI agent wrote out notes outlining his thought process.  The notes reflect that it was not clear whether the intent of the interview was to investigate a crime, push Flynn to lie, or get Flynn fired.  After the interview, the FBI records reflect that it was unclear whether Flynn had lied.  

However, thereafter, it became very important for the government to have a stick to wield against people close to Trump, so that they could obtain information supporting the allegation that Trump had colluded with Russia.  So Flynn, who had not by any defensible prosecutorial standard done anything wrong, was charged with lying to the FBI and heavily leaned on to plead out and dish some dirt on Trump.  

Some of the facts above may be portrayed in a way that is favorable to my argument.  But in the broad strokes, I think they're not really controversial.

,changemyview,"TL;DR: The usual argument is: ""People under 18 have poorer decision-making skills, so it makes sense to prevent them from making a harmful choice.""  I submit this is a fallacy, because even if the premise is true, that only means the proportion of under-18s who would make the harmful choice, is higher than the proportion of over-18s who would make the harmful choice.  But if your general principle is ""People ought to be protected from making bad judgments that harm themselves"", there's no reason that shouldn't apply equally to the under-18s and over-18s who made the harmful choice, even if the group of under-18s who made the harmful choice is proportionally larger.

(Of course, when I say ""There's no logically consistent reason to believe X"", I'm excluding the case where someone chooses as an \*axiom\* that ""Smoking should be banned for minors but not adults"", or more generally ""Minors should have fewer rights than adults.""  By definition, there's no arguing with ""axioms"", so their beliefs would be consistent.  But most people are not willing to admit they believe this axiomatically; almost everyone says that it follows as a logical consequence of some \*other\* axioms, like ""People with poor judgment should be protected from harming themselves.""  And that's where I say they're making the logical error above.)

Now sometimes you have two groups of people A and B, and group A is disproportionately likely to commit X, but you can't target in advance the people committing X, so you place restrictions on group A instead.  For example, in a women's college dorm, assume that an unaccompanied male visitor is far more likely than an unaccompanied female visitor to sexually assault one of the residents.  You don't know in advance who the potential assailants will be, so many colleges ban unaccompanied male visitors in women's dorms.  Fair or not, this is at least logically consistent.

But this makes no sense as applied to minors and adults smoking.  If you want to target the harmful behavior, you can just target it directly -- banning smoking -- rather than banning smoking among a subgroup of people that you think is disproportionately likely to make the wrong decision.

By analogy, men commit disproportionately more murders than women do.  But no sane person would argue that this that means that only men should be prohibited from committing murder!  But how is this different from the logic used to argue that only people under 18 should be prohibited from smoking?

(Or, perhaps you would insist that this is different because murderers harm other people but smokers harm themselves.  I don't think this makes a difference -- if you want to stop X, you should prohibit X, rather than prohibiting X only among a group that is disproportionately likely to do X -- but if you insist that the harm-to-others aspect changes things, then replace ""murder"" with ""suicide"".  Men are far more likely to commit suicide, but even in jurisdiction with anti-suicide laws, no sane person would argue that the laws should only apply to men.)

I realize that as a practical matter, there would be near-riots if you tried to force existing smokers to quit smoking.  But that's an argument for a kind of ""addict grandfather clause"", where existing smokers could get an exemption that would allow them to continue buying cigarettes just to avoid withdrawal.  It's not a moral argument for why a 27-year-old should be allowed to start smoking but a 17-year-old should not.

,changemyview,"I've just been reading about the DeVos ruling after hearing Biden said he would scrap it entirely. Not knowing what it even was, though I'd do some background reading.

As a preface, if I was an American I would probably vote Democrat myself (although reluctantly for Biden). I am not a conservative, and consider myself to hold socially progressive views.

That being said, it seems the Democrats are shamelessly over simplifying, and using their opposition to what seems a reasonable ruling.

In my view, whilst the Obama admins rulings to combat sexual misconduct made sense at the time (given how little was in place to help victims). As with all policies once implemented, issues start to arise and they need to be adjusted. 

In this case - from what I've read - accused students can be expelled or face charges on little or no evidence. There is no process in place and the situation encourages universities to assume guilt to protect themselves from a PR standpoint.

The result of these accusations can be devastating, not just to a students education and career, but to all their relationships as their reputation is tarnished forever by a horrendous crime. 

Rather than attacking the details of the new ruling, in an effort to find a fair middle ground. The Democrats specifically seem to be using this for their own means.

There is the timely condemnation of Biden, saying he'll throw the entire thing out. Coincidentally just as he is recovering from his own accusations of sexual misconduct. *on a side note, if he really has been falsely accused... surely he should have more sympathy for falsely accused students?

In the press, rather than attacking details of the rule, they are making sweeping, sloganistic statements about 'protecting victims'. Which is all well and good, but doesn't address the issues with the current regulation at all. 

It also completely ignores the fact this ruling actually expands the definition for sexual misconduct to include things like stalking, as well as widening the responsibility of universities. 

I think this is a prime example (in this case of Democrats, but Republicans are certainly guilty in other areas) of partisan politics clouding a important and nuanced issue.

It's a serious issue, and real people will lose out, all in the name of political ambition.",t2_qrzeq,FALSE,,0,FALSE,CMV: The Democrats are grossly over simplifying and using the DeVos ruling - on students accused of sexual misconduct - for their own political and election goals.,[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gf58pb,FALSE,dark,0.47,,public,0,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,0,,FALSE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588881845,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just been reading about the DeVos ruling after hearing Biden said he would scrap it entirely. Not knowing what it even was, though I&amp;#39;d do some background reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a preface, if I was an American I would probably vote Democrat myself (although reluctantly for Biden). I am not a conservative, and consider myself to hold socially progressive views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, it seems the Democrats are shamelessly over simplifying, and using their opposition to what seems a reasonable ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, whilst the Obama admins rulings to combat sexual misconduct made sense at the time (given how little was in place to help victims). As with all policies once implemented, issues start to arise and they need to be adjusted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case - from what I&amp;#39;ve read - accused students can be expelled or face charges on little or no evidence. There is no process in place and the situation encourages universities to assume guilt to protect themselves from a PR standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of these accusations can be devastating, not just to a students education and career, but to all their relationships as their reputation is tarnished forever by a horrendous crime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than attacking the details of the new ruling, in an effort to find a fair middle ground. The Democrats specifically seem to be using this for their own means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the timely condemnation of Biden, saying he&amp;#39;ll throw the entire thing out. Coincidentally just as he is recovering from his own accusations of sexual misconduct. *on a side note, if he really has been falsely accused... surely he should have more sympathy for falsely accused students?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the press, rather than attacking details of the rule, they are making sweeping, sloganistic statements about &amp;#39;protecting victims&amp;#39;. Which is all well and good, but doesn&amp;#39;t address the issues with the current regulation at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also completely ignores the fact this ruling actually expands the definition for sexual misconduct to include things like stalking, as well as widening the responsibility of universities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a prime example (in this case of Democrats, but Republicans are certainly guilty in other areas) of partisan politics clouding a important and nuanced issue. And being used to bolster the reputation of individuals (like Biden) and try and stoke fear and anger to help their election campaign.

- The word ""women"" doesn't cover it because not everyone who has a vagina is a woman (trans men, for example). 
- You also can't just say ""women and trans men"" because that includes trans women who were not born with a vagina. 
Therefore, the only way to accurately mention the group of people who were born with a vagina is to literally say ""people with a vagina"".

- It is necessary for certain medical advice to be targeted towards people with vaginas. Currently the word ""women"" is used for this purpose, and as I've argued that doesn't work.
- Historically there have been things that applied only to people with vaginas. For example, them not having the vote. Nowadays we tend to celebrate the fact that ""women got the vote"", but again that's not fully accurate. 
These are just a couple of examples I can think of, I'm sure there are more.

For example, our writing is so nonsensical and odd because froze our spelling in time around 250 years ago, with complete disregard for language evolution.

Then, we made dictionaries and strict books of proper grammar rules, putting English into even more of a straightjacket that doesn’t at all reflect how people use the language.

People regularly use and understand “y’all, ain’t,” double negatives, and other aspects of modern English language, yet English teachers will ignore all signs of language evolution over the past 250 years and insist on words like “whom” and “whilst” which nobody uses.

Anybody past the age of 13 is as fluent as they need to be in English, other than maybe a few extra vocabulary words here and there, and if schools insist on teaching English classes at all, it should at least reflect modern English, evolution and all.

“Proper” English does not exist. If two people can understand each other when they’re speaking, then that’s language, and if they’re speaking English, then that’s a legitimate part of the English language.

,changemyview,"The subreddit ""antiwork"" and associated ideologies are increasingly popular on reddit, anecdotally. By this I just mean, that subreddit has popped up on /r/all a few times, sometimes with very popular submissions. The majority of the content seems centered around perceived hypocrisies of capitalism, specifically as it pertains to equality, economic justice, etc...but the underlying philosophy of the subreddit seems to be:

1. People should not have to do work to live
2. People have a right to put effort only into what they *want* to be doing
3. Being ""forced"" to do anything other than what you *want* to be doing is simply exploitation of the working class to facilitate the wealthy being able to do what they *want* to be doing instead.

Now, for starters, I agree broadly that our current economic system, especially in the United States, has appalling lapses in economic justice. I think we're in the midst of a second gilded age, where wealth is increasingly concentrated at the top while lower- and middle-class wages struggle to keep up with cost of living increases. I'm broadly supportive of economic justice plans, including some iterations of universal basic income, or a negative income tax. I do not think your employment status should decide whether or not you live in basic dignity.

But work is still necessary.

This is because entropy exists.

In our universe, order tends to disorder. To decay. To rot.

Organisms, as evolved through Darwinian evolution, exist as a means of harnessing sunlight, directly or indirectly, to work against entropy. The primary goal of an organism's genes is to replicate themselves. They build bodies around themselves to navigate the world, entropy and all, to find a means of replicating themselves.

This means constantly fighting against entropy, because without fighting entropy and using energy to build up order, our bodies fall apart. This is what happens to dead bodies, and it's what would happen to a living body if it stopped doing ""work"" - that is to say, consuming and burning calories to fight entropy.

You might think: ""But that's a totally different definition of 'work' - that's not what antiwork is about - antiwork is about not having to work a *job.* It's not about not having to feed yourself and stuff.""

To me, there is almost no distinction.

For example, let's say I had no job and instead just lived off the land.

I would still have to work, quite damn hard, to produce food for myself off the land. Tilling the earth, sowing the seeds, fighting back pests, etc...all of this is ""work"" in a very real sense.

Let's say I'm much better at fighting back pests than I am at sowing seeds, but my neighbor is the opposite.

It would be a lot easier for both of us if I just fought back pests from *both* of our lands, and she sowed seeds on *both* of our lands. Because she's better at sowing seeds, it would take her less time to do both of our fields than it would take me to do mine and her to do hers. Likewise for me fighting back pests. By cooperating with each other, we cut back the effort needed to do the same work.

Now imagine if instead of her sowing seeds on my land, she gives me an I.O.U. that says ""I owe you sowed seeds for one harvest."" Then, she goes into town with some of her extra food and says to someone in town ""I will give you this extra food if you go sow my neighbor's seeds for him for the next harvest."" Then, instead of using my I.O.U. on my neighbor, I use it on that town resident who comes and sows my seeds.

This is essentially the basis for how money works.

When this system gets sufficiently complex, people are able to specialize more and more. To the point where you can enter an agreement to do one very specific thing in a very focused way, on behalf of a bunch of other people, and in return you get an equivalent amount of generalized I.O.U.s.

This is what a job is, in the modern era.

But the ""anti-work"" mindset forgets this. It relies on people losing sight of that fact behind many layers of abstraction, to the point that they forget that work is still fundamentally necessary to eat.

Even under a strict socialist or capitalist system, you still need a mechanism to organize labor to be productive enough to sustain the population. Even without the I.O.U. system, if instead you just rely on an authority directing the whole system (command and control economy) rather than an informal network of agreements, that doesn't change the fundamental fact that *work* is required to fight entropy.",t2_cr0ph,FALSE,,0,FALSE,"CMV: The philosophy behind ""anti-work"", an increasingly popular idea among anti-capitalists on Reddit, is fundamentally based on ignorance of how entropy works.",[],r/changemyview,FALSE,6,,0,FALSE,t3_gese9b,FALSE,dark,0.69,,public,83,0,{},,FALSE,[],,FALSE,FALSE,,{},,FALSE,83,,TRUE,,FALSE,,[],{},,TRUE,,1588827377,text,6,,,text,self.changemyview,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subreddit &amp;quot;antiwork&amp;quot; and associated ideologies are increasingly popular on reddit, anecdotally.

&lt;p&gt;Organisms, as evolved through Darwinian evolution, exist as a means of harnessing sunlight, directly or indirectly, to work against entropy. The primary goal of an organism&amp;#39;s genes is to replicate themselves. They build bodies around themselves to navigate the world, entropy and all, to find a means of replicating themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means constantly fighting against entropy, because without fighting entropy and using energy to build up order, our bodies fall apart. This is what happens to dead bodies, and it&amp;#39;s what would happen to a living body if it stopped doing &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; - that is to say, consuming and burning calories to fight entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think: &amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s a totally different definition of &amp;#39;work&amp;#39; - that&amp;#39;s not what antiwork is about - antiwork is about not having to work a &lt;em&gt;job.&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;#39;s not about not having to feed yourself and stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, there is almost no distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let&amp;#39;s say I had no job and instead just lived off the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would still have to work, quite damn hard, to produce food for myself off the land. Tilling the earth, sowing the seeds, fighting back pests, etc...all of this is &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; in a very real sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;m much better at fighting back pests than I am at sowing seeds, but my neighbor is the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a lot easier for both of us if I just fought back pests from &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of our lands, and she sowed seeds on &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of our lands. Because she&amp;#39;s better at sowing seeds, it would take her less time to do both of our fields than it would take me to do mine and her to do hers. Likewise for me fighting back pests. By cooperating with each other, we cut back the effort needed to do the same work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine if instead of her sowing seeds on my land, she gives me an I.O.U. that says &amp;quot;I owe you sowed seeds for one harvest.&amp;quot; Then, she goes into town with some of her extra food and says to someone in town &amp;quot;I will give you this extra food if you go sow my neighbor&amp;#39;s seeds for him for the next harvest.&amp;quot; Then, instead of using my I.O.U. on my neighbor, I use it on that town resident who comes and sows my seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the basis for how money works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this system gets sufficiently complex, people are able to specialize more and more. To the point where you can enter an agreement to do one very specific thing in a very focused way, on behalf of a bunch of other people, and in return you get an equivalent amount of generalized I.O.U.s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what a job is, in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &amp;quot;anti-work&amp;quot; mindset forgets this. It relies on people losing sight of that fact behind many layers of abstraction, to the point that they forget that work is still fundamentally necessary to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even under a strict socialist or capitalist system, you still need a mechanism to organize labor to be productive enough to sustain the population. Even without the I.O.U. system, if instead you just rely on an authority directing the whole system (command and control economy) rather than an informal network of agreements, that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fundamental fact that &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; is required to fight entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"As background, I do not support Trump, and I am an attorney with some white collar defense experience.  

In DOJ's motion to drop the charges, they set forth the factual background of the Flynn charges.  In a nutshell, Flynn had been the subject of an investigation into potential improper ties with foreign governments.  That investigation was on the verge of being closed - so close, in fact, that the closing memo had already been written, with the conclusion that there was no evidence that Flynn had committed any crime.  But around that time, there was smoke starting to swirl regarding Trump's - not Flynn's - potential collusion with Russia.  Peter Sztrok, the same FBI official who would later be dropped from Mueller's investigation team because of his text messages in which he and his mistress, Lisa Page, expressed the perception of themselves as America's last hope to avoid a Trump presidency, directed FBI personnel to keep the Flynn investigation open.  DOJ was apparently opposed to further inquiry at the time, because as far as they were concerned, there was no reason to believe Flynn had done anything wrong.  Meanwhile, Flynn, who had been named Trump's national security advisor, but had not come into office yet because Trump was not in office yet, conducted calls with foreign officials.  This is apparently common practice - the next president has been elected, and his cabinet begin getting themselves up to speed and begin building relationships with their counterparts in other countries.  However, it also may be a technical violation of the Logan Act, an obscure law that makes it a felony for private citizens to engage in ""diplomacy"" with hostile foreign national.  How obscure is the Logan Act?  It is 200 years old, was passed in the wake of some thorny negotiations during the John Adams administration, and has been the basis for a total of zero convictions in its history.  If someone were convicted, they would be subject to ""a fine"" or up to three years in prison.

Now, the following dots are not (I don't think) in the motion to dismiss, but are easy enough to connect.  The FBI knew that Flynn had a call with Sergei Kislyak, a Russian diplomat.  The FBI had a recording of the call.  On the call, Flynn had discussed in passing certain sanctions that were in place against Russia.  Technically, this could have been a violation of the Logan Act, which no prosecutor in their right mind would prosecute under these circumstances.  Although the FBI knew what the call was about, they decided that the open investigation into entirely different conduct warranted further inquiry into this call, and determined to have a ""friendly"" interview with Flynn.  By relying on the already-open investigation, they avoided the necessity to justify an investigation based on the very flimsy phone call.  They also conveniently neglected to tell DOJ they were continuing to investigate, because they knew DOJ would not agree to the interview without additional justification.  

In preparation for the interview, an FBI agent wrote out notes outlining his thought process.  The notes reflect that it was not clear whether the intent of the interview was to investigate a crime, push Flynn to lie, or get Flynn fired.  After the interview, the FBI records reflect that it was unclear whether Flynn had lied.  

However, thereafter, it became very important for the government to have a stick to wield against people close to Trump, so that they could obtain information supporting the allegation that Trump had colluded with Russia.  So Flynn, who had not by any defensible prosecutorial standard done anything wrong, was charged with lying to the FBI and heavily leaned on to plead out and dish some dirt on Trump.  

Some of the facts above may be portrayed in a way that is favorable to my argument.  But in the broad strokes, I think they're not really controversial.  Sure, the charges were dropped as a practical matter because the AG is loyal to Trump, and in an ideal world such decisions would not be based on political considerations.

If someone were convicted, they would be subject to &amp;quot;a fine&amp;quot; or up to three years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the following dots are not (I don&amp;#39;t think) in the motion to dismiss, but are easy enough to connect.  The FBI knew that Flynn had a call with Sergei Kislyak, a Russian diplomat.  The FBI had a recording of the call.  On the call, Flynn had discussed in passing certain sanctions that were in place against Russia.  Technically, this could have been a violation of the Logan Act, which no prosecutor in their right mind would prosecute under these circumstances.  Although the FBI knew what the call was about, they decided that the open investigation into entirely different conduct warranted further inquiry into this call, and determined to have a &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; interview with Flynn.  By relying on the already-open investigation, they avoided the necessity to justify an investigation based on the very flimsy phone call.  They also conveniently neglected to tell DOJ they were continuing to investigate, because they knew DOJ would not agree to the interview without additional justification.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the interview, an FBI agent wrote out notes outlining his thought process.  The notes reflect that it was not clear whether the intent of the interview was to investigate a crime, push Flynn to lie, or get Flynn fired.  After the interview, the FBI records reflect that it was unclear whether Flynn had lied.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, thereafter, it became very important for the government to have a stick to wield against people close to Trump, so that they could obtain information supporting the allegation that Trump had colluded with Russia.  So Flynn, who had not by any defensible prosecutorial standard done anything wrong, was charged with lying to the FBI and heavily leaned on to plead out and dish some dirt on Trump.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the facts above may be portrayed in a way that is favorable to my argument.  But in the broad strokes, I think they&amp;#39;re not really controversial.  Sure, the charges were dropped as a practical matter because the AG is loyal to Trump, and in an ideal world such decisions would not be based on political considerations.  But given the nature of the charges here, I don&amp;#39;t understand how anyone can argue the outcome is unjust.&lt;/p&gt;

,changemyview,"TL;DR: The usual argument is: ""People under 18 have poorer decision-making skills, so it makes sense to prevent them from making a harmful choice.""  I submit this is a fallacy, because even if the premise is true, that only means the proportion of under-18s who would make the harmful choice, is higher than the proportion of over-18s who would make the harmful choice.  But if your general principle is ""People ought to be protected from making bad judgments that harm themselves"", there's no reason that shouldn't apply equally to the under-18s and over-18s who made the harmful choice, even if the group of under-18s who made the harmful choice is proportionally larger.

(Of course, when I say ""There's no logically consistent reason to believe X"", I'm excluding the case where someone chooses as an \*axiom\* that ""Smoking should be banned for minors but not adults"", or more generally ""Minors should have fewer rights than adults.""  By definition, there's no arguing with ""axioms"", so their beliefs would be consistent.  But most people are not willing to admit they believe this axiomatically; almost everyone says that it follows as a logical consequence of some \*other\* axioms, like ""People with poor judgment should be protected from harming themselves.""  And that's where I say they're making the logical error above.)

Now sometimes you have two groups of people A and B, and group A is disproportionately likely to commit X, but you can't target in advance the people committing X, so you place restrictions on group A instead.  For example, in a women's college dorm, assume that an unaccompanied male visitor is far more likely than an unaccompanied female visitor to sexually assault one of the residents.  You don't know in advance who the potential assailants will be, so many colleges ban unaccompanied male visitors in women's dorms.  Fair or not, this is at least logically consistent.

But this makes no sense as applied to minors and adults smoking.  If you want to target the harmful behavior, you can just target it directly -- banning smoking -- rather than banning smoking among a subgroup of people that you think is disproportionately likely to make the wrong decision.

By analogy, men commit disproportionately more murders than women do.  But no sane person would argue that this that means that only men should be prohibited from committing murder!  But how is this different from the logic used to argue that only people under 18 should be prohibited from smoking?

(Or, perhaps you would insist that this is different because murderers harm other people but smokers harm themselves.  I don't think this makes a difference -- if you want to stop X, you should prohibit X, rather than prohibiting X only among a group that is disproportionately likely to do X -- but if you insist that the harm-to-others aspect changes things, then replace ""murder"" with ""suicide"".  Men are far more likely to commit suicide, but even in jurisdiction with anti-suicide laws, no sane person would argue that the laws should only apply to men.)

I realize that as a practical matter, there would be near-riots if you tried to force existing smokers to quit smoking.  But that's an argument for a kind of ""addict grandfather clause"", where existing smokers could get an exemption that would allow them to continue buying cigarettes just to avoid withdrawal.  It's not a moral argument for why a 27-year-old should be allowed to start smoking but a 17-year-old should not.

,changemyview,"Why I don't think this word exists:
- The word ""women"" doesn't cover it because not everyone who has a vagina is a woman (trans men, for example). 
- You also can't just say ""women and trans men"" because that includes trans women who were not born with a vagina. 
Therefore, the only way to accurately mention the group of people who were born with a vagina is to literally say ""people with a vagina"".

Why I think this word should exist:
- It is necessary for certain medical advice to be targeted towards people with vaginas. Currently the word ""women"" is used for this purpose, and as I've argued that doesn't work.
- Historically there have been things that applied only to people with vaginas. For example, them not having the vote. Nowadays we tend to celebrate the fact that ""women got the vote"", but again that's not fully accurate. 
These are just a couple of examples I can think of, I'm sure there are more.

I think that if we do not make a word that describes only people with vaginas, people will continue to use the word ""woman"" for this purpose with a negative impact on trans rights.

- The word &amp;quot;women&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t cover it because not everyone who has a vagina is a woman (trans men, for example). 
- You also can&amp;#39;t just say &amp;quot;women and trans men&amp;quot; because that includes trans women who were not born with a vagina. 
Therefore, the only way to accurately mention the group of people who were born with a vagina is to literally say &amp;quot;people with a vagina&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I think this word should exist:
- It is necessary for certain medical advice to be targeted towards people with vaginas. Currently the word &amp;quot;women&amp;quot; is used for this purpose, and as I&amp;#39;ve argued that doesn&amp;#39;t work.
- Historically there have been things that applied only to people with vaginas. For example, them not having the vote. Nowadays we tend to celebrate the fact that &amp;quot;women got the vote&amp;quot;, but again that&amp;#39;s not fully accurate.

,changemyview,"First of all, I believe early elementary school is where we get actual, vital education. English classes in those grades teach you things like literacy and the foundational basics of grammar, which are, needlessly to say, invaluable. Even though my 2nd grade teacher thought me to write every single letter backwards and I still do it to this day.

But once you hit around late elementary school, when you’re completely literate, need no new words to express most given ideas, and you know how to use grammar in a way that people around you will understand, it just becomes this circlejerk of grammar-nazi-ing, the word ‘whom,’ and old Shakespeare shit. And oddly, they don’t even try and expand your vocabulary, which is something those kids could actually benefit from, because the word ‘whom’ and Shakespeare are more important, obviously.

Language is an ever-changing, irregular thing, and it always has been. Yet a couple hundred years ago, we started to make the mistake of trying to aggressively standardize English.

For example, our writing is so nonsensical and odd because froze our spelling in time around 250 years ago, with complete disregard for language evolution.

Then, we made dictionaries and strict books of proper grammar rules, putting English into even more of a straightjacket that doesn’t at all reflect how people use the language.

People regularly use and understand “y’all, ain’t,” double negatives, and other aspects of modern English language, yet English teachers will ignore all signs of language evolution over the past 250 years and insist on words like “whom” and “whilst” which nobody uses.

Anybody past the age of 13 is as fluent as they need to be in English, other than maybe a few extra vocabulary words here and there, and if schools insist on teaching English classes at all, it should at least reflect modern English, evolution and all.

“Proper” English does not exist. If two people can understand each other when they’re speaking, then that’s language, and if they’re speaking English, then that’s a legitimate part of the English language. If people understand it, then guess what? It’s a word. If people drop grammar rules over the years (which they have, for example, dropping the word “whom”), then that’s English too. I don’t know why I need an old woman who’s really into books to teach me how to talk like teenage Shakespeare, and I don’t know why they want us to. It really goes to show how much they know about “English,” but how little they know about language.

If we continue this freezing and straightjacketing of our language, our spelling will become next to gibberish, and our dictionaries will look like an entirely different language as opposed to how people actually speak, among other linguistic abominations.
