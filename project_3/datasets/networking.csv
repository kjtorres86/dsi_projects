,networking,"I could use a brain check/fresh minds on this.  Any Cisco gurus up tonight?

I've got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.  

I've built a bunch of tunnels Cisco &gt; Sonicwall where both sides have public IPs.  So many that it's beyond routine - I have a template.  The problem I'm having is with the Cisco initiating.  

My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it's just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it's simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I'm stumped.  

I have my ACL, transform-set, crypto-map, NAT exclusion - I think everything is there.  I can ping the SW's WAN from the Cisco CLI.  PCAP in the SW doesn't show any attempts to even start phase 1.

,networking,"Hi There,

i'm looking for a new Hardware vendor for a specific purpose.

We are going to integrate a new Layer2 circuit provider that will deliver Layer2 transport services  up to 900 MBit/s on a 10G E-NNI Link. These virtual EPL Circuits allow a maximum burst (Bc) of 12,5 kBytes (MEF recommendation) , independent of the bandwidth.

Unfortunately i can't use our Juniper MX boxes to produce internet services based on this new Layer2 services because the minimum burst that the MX can deliver is a Tc of about 1,69ms which completely saturates the WAN circuit and is leading to excessive drops and a very bad TCP performance.

So i'm looking for an alternative edge router for this use case. 

The first (and most direct) idea is to switch to Cisco ASR1000 that has a quite powerful shaper performance and is able to produce a nearly zero-burst CIR.

Are there any suggestions for an alternative to the ASR1000? Does anybody know if Nokia is able to deliver here? Huawei is no option.

It has been open for 6 years and all of the equipment was purchased and networking was done prior to opening day. We are currently running Comcast business internet with a technicolor DPC3941B modem/router. 

The router is first connected to a seperate router (I believe an Arris model, lost my note), then a switch and our Point of Sale stations and printers, all by ethernet.

Secondly, the Comcast router is connected to a Luxul Switch, which is then connected to 3 PoE injectors, and then 3 Luxul APs. 2 are for our guest WiFi network, and 1 for Office/Administrative network.

Lastly, the comcast router is connected to a DVR for our multiple coaxial cameras.

We have been experiencing some intermittent issues with our internet connectivity over our wireless network. The wireless signal itself is pretty consistent and strong, but some devices connected are often unable to connect to the internet or appear to be connected but recieve DNS errors or are just unable to do anyhting online. I have had Comcast, a local IT firm tech, and a tech firm director (whom the owner knows personally) come out and it seems the general consensus is our equipment is outdated or unable to handle the user load.

I'm in a bit over my head, but feel like this setup may be a bit overkill. A colleague recommended Ubiquiti, as that is what they use at their restaurant, but couldn't produce much more of a reason. I guess my questions are:

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in a bit over my head, but feel like this setup may be a bit overkill. A colleague recommended Ubiquiti, as that is what they use at their restaurant, but couldn&amp;#39;t produce much more of a reason. I guess my questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this seem like a proper setup for the needs I have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a comparable setup for a fraction for the price? say &amp;lt;$1800?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the purposes/benefits of licensed equipement?&lt;/p&gt;

\- DHCP Server is Windows-based.

\- Prevent unauthorized devices from getting accessing the network (essentially, no DHCP for unauthorized devices)

\- Should work for both wired and wireless devices

\- Allow connectivity for devices pre-registered by MAC address (aware that MAC addresses can be spoofed)

\- Allow for BYOD with sign-in portal based on Active Directory login credentials

I've got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.  

I've built a bunch of tunnels Cisco &gt; Sonicwall where both sides have public IPs.  So many that it's beyond routine - I have a template.  The problem I'm having is with the Cisco initiating.  

My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it's just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it's simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I'm stumped.  

I have my ACL, transform-set, crypto-map, NAT exclusion - I think everything is there.  I can ping the SW's WAN from the Cisco CLI.  PCAP in the SW doesn't show any attempts to even start phase 1.

Any Cisco gurus up tonight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve built a bunch of tunnels Cisco &amp;gt; Sonicwall where both sides have public IPs.  So many that it&amp;#39;s beyond routine - I have a template.  The problem I&amp;#39;m having is with the Cisco initiating.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it&amp;#39;s just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it&amp;#39;s simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I&amp;#39;m stumped.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my ACL, transform-set, crypto-map, NAT exclusion - I think everything is there.  I can ping the SW&amp;#39;s WAN from the Cisco CLI.  PCAP in the SW doesn&amp;#39;t show any attempts to even start phase 1.&lt;/p&gt;

,networking,"Hi There,

i'm looking for a new Hardware vendor for a specific purpose.

We are going to integrate a new Layer2 circuit provider that will deliver Layer2 transport services  up to 900 MBit/s on a 10G E-NNI Link. These virtual EPL Circuits allow a maximum burst (Bc) of 12,5 kBytes (MEF recommendation) , independent of the bandwidth.

Unfortunately i can't use our Juniper MX boxes to produce internet services based on this new Layer2 services because the minimum burst that the MX can deliver is a Tc of about 1,69ms which completely saturates the WAN circuit and is leading to excessive drops and a very bad TCP performance.

So i'm looking for an alternative edge router for this use case. 

The first (and most direct) idea is to switch to Cisco ASR1000 that has a quite powerful shaper performance and is able to produce a nearly zero-burst CIR.

Are there any suggestions for an alternative to the ASR1000? Does anybody know if Nokia is able to deliver here? Huawei is no option.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for some examples of how to best track and display information on what fibre goes to what. We have around 40 24p SC / LC fibre panels in our main DC and no tracking of what gets plugged where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not great I&amp;#39;m sure you will agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our documentation of what is in the racks is in the form of an excel spreadsheet with the cabinet recorded U by U. If there was something I could integrate into this so when I clicked on say a fibre panel in the spreadsheet, it could show me something that says what connects to each port on the panel that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

The router is first connected to a seperate router (I believe an Arris model, lost my note), then a switch and our Point of Sale stations and printers, all by ethernet.

Secondly, the Comcast router is connected to a Luxul Switch, which is then connected to 3 PoE injectors, and then 3 Luxul APs. 2 are for our guest WiFi network, and 1 for Office/Administrative network.

Lastly, the comcast router is connected to a DVR for our multiple coaxial cameras.

We have been experiencing some intermittent issues with our internet connectivity over our wireless network. The wireless signal itself is pretty consistent and strong, but some devices connected are often unable to connect to the internet or appear to be connected but recieve DNS errors or are just unable to do anyhting online. I have had Comcast, a local IT firm tech, and a tech firm director (whom the owner knows personally) come out and it seems the general consensus is our equipment is outdated or unable to handle the user load.

I'm in the market for an NAC solution for a simple network setup.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the overview:

\- Flat network/subnet. Cannot be changed at this time.

\- Switches are not capable for utilizing VLANs. Switches cannot be changed out at this time.

\- DHCP Server is Windows-based.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what we are hoping to achieve:

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the market for an NAC solution for a simple network setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the overview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Flat network/subnet. Cannot be changed at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Switches are not capable for utilizing VLANs. Switches cannot be changed out at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- DHCP Server is Windows-based.&lt;/p&gt;

I've got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.  

I've built a bunch of tunnels Cisco &gt; Sonicwall where both sides have public IPs.  So many that it's beyond routine - I have a template.  The problem I'm having is with the Cisco initiating.  

My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it's just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it's simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I'm stumped.  

I have my ACL, transform-set, crypto-map, NAT exclusion - I think everything is there.  I can ping the SW's WAN from the Cisco CLI.  PCAP in the SW doesn't show any attempts to even start phase 1.

,networking,"So, I work for an MSP, who has a customer that uses charter as a secondary connection for 100+ locations through some type of broker, not sure of the deal.. We've been experiencing packet loss on a few of these connections ranging from 5-10%, and opened tickets on a couple of the more problematic ones where i saw what looked like layer 1 issues on the cable line.  I got a surprising reply where they asked me to not access their ""configuration"" page (192.168.100.1) in the future.. Mind that it's a completely non password protected page that doesn't allow you to change anything.. I plan on going down the malicious compliance route and opening tickets on every minor blip I see asking then to check the line, but just wondering, is this a normal support response or is this broker just not wantIng to deal with us and figures if I can't see errors on the line, I won't bother them.

,networking,"Hi There,

i'm looking for a new Hardware vendor for a specific purpose.

We are going to integrate a new Layer2 circuit provider that will deliver Layer2 transport services  up to 900 MBit/s on a 10G E-NNI Link. These virtual EPL Circuits allow a maximum burst (Bc) of 12,5 kBytes (MEF recommendation) , independent of the bandwidth.

Unfortunately i can't use our Juniper MX boxes to produce internet services based on this new Layer2 services because the minimum burst that the MX can deliver is a Tc of about 1,69ms which completely saturates the WAN circuit and is leading to excessive drops and a very bad TCP performance.

So i'm looking for an alternative edge router for this use case. 

The first (and most direct) idea is to switch to Cisco ASR1000 that has a quite powerful shaper performance and is able to produce a nearly zero-burst CIR.

Are there any suggestions for an alternative to the ASR1000? Does anybody know if Nokia is able to deliver here? Huawei is no option.

It has been open for 6 years and all of the equipment was purchased and networking was done prior to opening day. We are currently running Comcast business internet with a technicolor DPC3941B modem/router. 

The router is first connected to a seperate router (I believe an Arris model, lost my note), then a switch and our Point of Sale stations and printers, all by ethernet.

Secondly, the Comcast router is connected to a Luxul Switch, which is then connected to 3 PoE injectors, and then 3 Luxul APs. 2 are for our guest WiFi network, and 1 for Office/Administrative network.

Lastly, the comcast router is connected to a DVR for our multiple coaxial cameras.

We have been experiencing some intermittent issues with our internet connectivity over our wireless network. The wireless signal itself is pretty consistent and strong, but some devices connected are often unable to connect to the internet or appear to be connected but recieve DNS errors or are just unable to do anyhting online. I have had Comcast, a local IT firm tech, and a tech firm director (whom the owner knows personally) come out and it seems the general consensus is our equipment is outdated or unable to handle the user load.

The latter of opinions set me up with a Cisco Meraki dealer and I was recently qouted $2400ish for 3 MR33 APs and a 26 port switch, a free/trial MX65 router. 

I'm in a bit over my head, but feel like this setup may be a bit overkill. A colleague recommended Ubiquiti, as that is what they use at their restaurant, but couldn't produce much more of a reason. I guess my questions are:

I'm currently on my first new server/rack deployment and I'm having some trouble.  I'm trying to track down a budget friendly switch that has at least 4 10G and is stackable.

The problem I'm having (especially with cisco) is finding switches that are current.  It feels like every time I find a model even on their site the switches are End of Sale and only a couple years away from end of service.  


Is there any good 3rd party site to input the specs you are looking for that will output relevant models?  Most Vendor and 3rd party site are meh, CDW's is pretty good but they are the ones who inaccurately listed the port specs so i'm kind of gun shy.

I'm in the market for an NAC solution for a simple network setup.

Here's the overview:

\- Flat network/subnet. Cannot be changed at this time.

\- Switches are not capable for utilizing VLANs. Switches cannot be changed out at this time.

\- DHCP Server is Windows-based.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what we are hoping to achieve:

\- Prevent unauthorized devices from getting accessing the network (essentially, no DHCP for unauthorized devices)

\- Should work for both wired and wireless devices

\- Allow connectivity for devices pre-registered by MAC address (aware that MAC addresses can be spoofed)

\- Allow for BYOD with sign-in portal based on Active Directory login credentials

,networking,"I could use a brain check/fresh minds on this.  Any Cisco gurus up tonight?

I've got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.  

I've built a bunch of tunnels Cisco &gt; Sonicwall where both sides have public IPs.  So many that it's beyond routine - I have a template.  The problem I'm having is with the Cisco initiating.  

My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it's just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it's simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I'm stumped.  

I have my ACL, transform-set, crypto-map, NAT exclusion - I think everything is there.  I can ping the SW's WAN from the Cisco CLI.  PCAP in the SW doesn't show any attempts to even start phase 1.

,networking,"Hi There,

i'm looking for a new Hardware vendor for a specific purpose.

We are going to integrate a new Layer2 circuit provider that will deliver Layer2 transport services  up to 900 MBit/s on a 10G E-NNI Link. These virtual EPL Circuits allow a maximum burst (Bc) of 12,5 kBytes (MEF recommendation) , independent of the bandwidth.

Unfortunately i can't use our Juniper MX boxes to produce internet services based on this new Layer2 services because the minimum burst that the MX can deliver is a Tc of about 1,69ms which completely saturates the WAN circuit and is leading to excessive drops and a very bad TCP performance.

So i'm looking for an alternative edge router for this use case. 

The first (and most direct) idea is to switch to Cisco ASR1000 that has a quite powerful shaper performance and is able to produce a nearly zero-burst CIR.

Are there any suggestions for an alternative to the ASR1000? Does anybody know if Nokia is able to deliver here? Huawei is no option.

I'm looking for some examples of how to best track and display information on what fibre goes to what. We have around 40 24p SC / LC fibre panels in our main DC and no tracking of what gets plugged where.

Not great I'm sure you will agree.

Most of our documentation of what is in the racks is in the form of an excel spreadsheet with the cabinet recorded U by U. If there was something I could integrate into this so when I clicked on say a fibre panel in the spreadsheet, it could show me something that says what connects to each port on the panel that would be great.

Secondly, the Comcast router is connected to a Luxul Switch, which is then connected to 3 PoE injectors, and then 3 Luxul APs. 2 are for our guest WiFi network, and 1 for Office/Administrative network.

Lastly, the comcast router is connected to a DVR for our multiple coaxial cameras.

We have been experiencing some intermittent issues with our internet connectivity over our wireless network. The wireless signal itself is pretty consistent and strong, but some devices connected are often unable to connect to the internet or appear to be connected but recieve DNS errors or are just unable to do anyhting online.

I'm currently on my first new server/rack deployment and I'm having some trouble.  I'm trying to track down a budget friendly switch that has at least 4 10G and is stackable.  I thought I had hit gold with a SG350X from Cisco only to realize the site I was looking at incorrectly listed the 48 ports as 10GBase-T when in actuality they were 1G :(  


The problem I'm having (especially with cisco) is finding switches that are current.  It feels like every time I find a model even on their site the switches are End of Sale and only a couple years away from end of service.  


Is there any good 3rd party site to input the specs you are looking for that will output relevant models?  Most Vendor and 3rd party site are meh, CDW's is pretty good but they are the ones who inaccurately listed the port specs so i'm kind of gun shy.

I'm in the market for an NAC solution for a simple network setup.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the overview:

\- Flat network/subnet. Cannot be changed at this time.

\- Switches are not capable for utilizing VLANs. Switches cannot be changed out at this time.

\- DHCP Server is Windows-based.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what we are hoping to achieve:

\- Prevent unauthorized devices from getting accessing the network (essentially, no DHCP for unauthorized devices)

\- Should work for both wired and wireless devices

\- Allow connectivity for devices pre-registered by MAC address (aware that MAC addresses can be spoofed)

\- Allow for BYOD with sign-in portal based on Active Directory login credentials

I've got a Cisco ASA 5516-X that is sitting behind the gateway (NATted), trying to establish a VPN to a Sonicwall with a public IP address.  The Cisco has a private IP on its GigE1/1 / outside interface, and a /30 used on GigE 1/8 / mgmt and the FirePOWER module.  The purpose is to create a VPN back to a private network on which sits an FMC environment.

My normal processis to turn on keep-alive in the Sonicwall, since it's just a checkbox and main mode/IKEv1; it's simple and straightforward.  In this case I need to get the Cisco to establish the tunnel, and on that point I'm stumped.

,networking,"Hi There,

i'm looking for a new Hardware vendor for a specific purpose.

We are going to integrate a new Layer2 circuit provider that will deliver Layer2 transport services  up to 900 MBit/s on a 10G E-NNI Link. These virtual EPL Circuits allow a maximum burst (Bc) of 12,5 kBytes (MEF recommendation) , independent of the bandwidth.

Unfortunately i can't use our Juniper MX boxes to produce internet services based on this new Layer2 services because the minimum burst that the MX can deliver is a Tc of about 1,69ms which completely saturates the WAN circuit and is leading to excessive drops and a very bad TCP performance.

So i'm looking for an alternative edge router for this use case. 

The first (and most direct) idea is to switch to Cisco ASR1000 that has a quite powerful shaper performance and is able to produce a nearly zero-burst CIR.

Are there any suggestions for an alternative to the ASR1000? Does anybody know if Nokia is able to deliver here? Huawei is no option.

It has been open for 6 years and all of the equipment was purchased and networking was done prior to opening day. We are currently running Comcast business internet with a technicolor DPC3941B modem/router. 

The router is first connected to a seperate router (I believe an Arris model, lost my note), then a switch and our Point of Sale stations and printers, all by ethernet.

Secondly, the Comcast router is connected to a Luxul Switch, which is then connected to 3 PoE injectors, and then 3 Luxul APs. 2 are for our guest WiFi network, and 1 for Office/Administrative network.

Lastly, the comcast router is connected to a DVR for our multiple coaxial cameras.

We have been experiencing some intermittent issues with our internet connectivity over our wireless network. The wireless signal itself is pretty consistent and strong, but some devices connected are often unable to connect to the internet or appear to be connected but recieve DNS errors or are just unable to do anyhting online. I have had Comcast, a local IT firm tech, and a tech firm director (whom the owner knows personally) come out and it seems the general consensus is our equipment is outdated or unable to handle the user load.

\- DHCP Server is Windows-based.

\- Prevent unauthorized devices from getting accessing the network (essentially, no DHCP for unauthorized devices)

\- Should work for both wired and wireless devices

\- Allow connectivity for devices pre-registered by MAC address (aware that MAC addresses can be spoofed)

\- Allow for BYOD with sign-in portal based on Active Directory login credentials
