# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# If you lose your job or are at risk of losing your job

Please read the **[Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)**.

**If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.**

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Travel

If you have travel planned, read *[Coronavirus &amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel)* from Clark Howard.

Also see the [megathread on /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/) for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your loan is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930""&gt;Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers""&gt;The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State deadlines are not affected by the extension&lt;/strong&gt;, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). &lt;a href=""https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf""&gt;The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states&amp;#39; filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break""&gt;The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details and &lt;strong&gt;numerous warnings&lt;/strong&gt; about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance," Recently I saw my future income rising and decided to lock in a lease agreement to rent a nicer apartment. I was doing well in my job and a friend's small business I had been helping for many months was beginning to turn over enough revenue to create a side stream of income. 

However what ended up happening was sales began to slump at the end of last year and the amount I had earned from my main job began to decrease. The business I had been supporting was also put into a position where it could no longer pay me for the work I was doing to help keep it running.

All of a sudden the amount of money I was spending became more than the amount I was earning and I realized very quickly that I had made a mistake to increase the amount I was paying in rent. 

I began to feel very depressed and calculated that if I went on spending what I was currently spending with my new income I would be burning over $1000 dollars a month.

I was in a lease for 10 more months and it would cost me over $3000 to break lease early and many more associated costs if I was going to move out of my apartment. Uh OH! There was only one option. I had to REALLY tighten the belt if I was going to survive this storm I had entered into.

Using the spreadsheet I had used to figure out how much I was going to lose each month I went in deeper to understand not what I was spending all up but what I was spending individually. The big things were eating out, alcohol at bars and Ubers, and I also realized that I was spending about $40 a month on subscriptions too. I began to cut all of these things out, by cooking more at home and not eating out anymore. Not drinking at bars anymore and cancelling all my subscriptions and reading books from online instead. I also began to catch public transport or walk instead of taking Ubers.

In my first month I spent $500 less, The exercise has made me go through all my expenses and now I understand how much I spend on everything each month. When COVID hit it was like I was already adjusted! Since COVID I am now spending Over $750 a month LESS! When I think of spending for convenience I think about earning that money through not choosing that option. It is very helpful.

I also have become more confident and value money far more now. Now I know how much it costs for me to live each month. I know how long each dollar saved will support me if I lose my income entirely and see this as freedom! 

It has not been easy and I still feel depressed like today when I am worried about my future and not sleeping enough. But I wanted to write this post to remind myself of how much I’ve grown from the experience and that whatever happens it is just another opportunity for me to learn new skills and take more control and responsibility!

I have been humbled and when I am back fully on my feet again I will not take my money for granted. I will not let myself spend more than 20% of the money that goes above my new monthly cost number. The other 80% will be saved and invested in something to secure my future and help me become less frightened and scared. 

If you are going through hard times I hope you find a way to see the light and grow stronger and more confident as a result in a way that can be maintained long term!

,personalfinance,"Due to COVID-19, my internship has recently been converted into a remote internship and I no longer needed to live in New York over the summer. I contacted my landlord about canceling my lease and she said that she could make special accommodations because of the pandemic. She offered to terminate my lease a month early, which means I would no longer be liable for 1 month's rent -- awesome. 

However, in the early termination contract she sent over, I noticed there was no mention of the security deposit. Wanting to be safe than sorry, I didn't sign the contract and instead emailed my landlord back a simple ""hey, when can I expect a refund of my security deposit?"" She says, ""sorry, we can only refund a portion of your deposit, and only if  someone re-rents the apartment for the month that you backed out of."" 

I was bummed. I'd be saving money by canceling one month's rent, but my security deposit was roughly equivalent to a month's worth of rent, so essentially I'd be back to square one. I thought that there might be a way out of this, so I dug up the original 43-page lease agreement and skimmed the contract until I found the clauses on early termination and the security deposit. I pointed out to my landlord that early termination was not outlined as a reason to withhold the security deposit. After 36 hours of no-response from her (she had been responding every 1-2 hours up until this point), she simply followed up with a new version of the early termination contract that stated I would receive my security deposit back and said ""Sorry for the miscommunication. You will get your security deposit back in full."" 

Boom! By talking to my landlord and reading the contract carefully, I saved myself almost $4500 in total (security deposit &amp; rent).

Wanting to be safe than sorry, I didn&amp;#39;t sign the contract and instead emailed my landlord back a simple &amp;quot;hey, when can I expect a refund of my security deposit?&amp;quot; She says, &amp;quot;sorry, we can only refund a portion of your deposit, and only if  someone re-rents the apartment for the month that you backed out of.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was bummed. I&amp;#39;d be saving money by canceling one month&amp;#39;s rent, but my security deposit was roughly equivalent to a month&amp;#39;s worth of rent, so essentially I&amp;#39;d be back to square one. I thought that there might be a way out of this, so I dug up the original 43-page lease agreement and skimmed the contract until I found the clauses on early termination and the security deposit. I pointed out to my landlord that early termination was not outlined as a reason to withhold the security deposit. After 36 hours of no-response from her (she had been responding every 1-2 hours up until this point), she simply followed up with a new version of the early termination contract that stated I would receive my security deposit back and said &amp;quot;Sorry for the miscommunication. You will get your security deposit back in full.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom! By talking to my landlord and reading the contract carefully, I saved myself almost $4500 in total (security deposit &amp;amp; rent). Granted, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have signed a lease for such an expensive apartment in the first place, but I&amp;#39;m really happy with the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought I would add some perspective with a longer term look at dog expenses. I've got a full image breakdown here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/G60VYi0)
And an image for the dog tax here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/Z372VAq)

Total Costs - $13,841.83
Notable Costs:  
 Vet Bills - $3705.15
   Food/Toys/Supplies - $4948.25
   Boarding/Kennels/Rover - $1863.59

Vet Bills: This includes surgery required right after we got her for a root canal. A couple of appointments for broken dew claws (she was a very active dog in her youth, still is :), and a visit to the dog ER for some major vomiting/diarrhea issues about a year ago. Other than that this is the cost of yearly checkups/shots and heartworm medication.

Food/Toys/Supplies: The majority of this is for food and frontline from Costco. I found that their food agrees with my dog and I can get a large bag of the blue buffalo knockoff stuff for $35. She needs about 1 bag of food a month. Frontline is also dirt cheap there at $35ish for a 6 month supply. This also includes some toys, and the price of a few dog beds. Usually a bed lasts about 2 years it seems in her kennel before she scratches it apart.

Boarding/Kennels/Rover: Costs to board her when she cant stay with friends/family. We usually take one big week long vacation a year where she gets boarded. Other than that its maybe 2-3 over nights a year on top of our vacation. Rover we also found to be cheaper/closer once we found someone in our neighborhood. The dog also seems to like it a lot more.

The rest of the expenses in the list are pretty rink-a-dink one off things. Random toys/treats, some training costs from when we first got her, the initial adoption cost. The cost for PetPlan was after I was spending a ton of money on her at the vet in the first year. I thought dog insurance would be worth the cost. I quickly learned that it isnt. They have loopholes big enough to drive a semi through, and I see no way to justify the expense unless you have a pure breed dog that you know for certain will have high vet costs.

Please feel free to ask any questions! I love tracking my expenses and personal finance.

So I have recently been put on temporary secondment at a different department at the same company I work at. I had two weeks of training that were work from home and the role itself hasn't been TOO bad, but it's mainly been the people.

,personalfinance,"Given the number of requests we've had to post a megathread along with the volume of similar threads being submitted, we're consolidating future general discussion on this topic here.

**We will continue to make updates to this post.**

# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will continue to make updates to this post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments""&gt;https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don&amp;#39;t wreck yourself checking every five minutes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior years&amp;#39; tax returns are being used to calculate each person&amp;#39;s stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you&amp;#39;ll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will I get paid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran&amp;#39;s Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I am a dependent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels bad, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can&amp;#39;t be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;#39;s important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this just an &amp;quot;advance&amp;quot; on my tax refund?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Assuming you&amp;#39;re eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html""&gt;this article from CNN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/""&gt;Washington Post has a similar statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know""&gt;In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;If you lose your job or are at risk of losing your job&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/""&gt;Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance," Recently I saw my future income rising and decided to lock in a lease agreement to rent a nicer apartment. I was doing well in my job and a friend's small business I had been helping for many months was beginning to turn over enough revenue to create a side stream of income. 

However what ended up happening was sales began to slump at the end of last year and the amount I had earned from my main job began to decrease. The business I had been supporting was also put into a position where it could no longer pay me for the work I was doing to help keep it running.

All of a sudden the amount of money I was spending became more than the amount I was earning and I realized very quickly that I had made a mistake to increase the amount I was paying in rent. 

I began to feel very depressed and calculated that if I went on spending what I was currently spending with my new income I would be burning over $1000 dollars a month.

I was in a lease for 10 more months and it would cost me over $3000 to break lease early and many more associated costs if I was going to move out of my apartment. Uh OH! There was only one option. I had to REALLY tighten the belt if I was going to survive this storm I had entered into.

Using the spreadsheet I had used to figure out how much I was going to lose each month I went in deeper to understand not what I was spending all up but what I was spending individually. The big things were eating out, alcohol at bars and Ubers, and I also realized that I was spending about $40 a month on subscriptions too. I began to cut all of these things out, by cooking more at home and not eating out anymore. Not drinking at bars anymore and cancelling all my subscriptions and reading books from online instead. I also began to catch public transport or walk instead of taking Ubers.

In my first month I spent $500 less, The exercise has made me go through all my expenses and now I understand how much I spend on everything each month. When COVID hit it was like I was already adjusted! Since COVID I am now spending Over $750 a month LESS! When I think of spending for convenience I think about earning that money through not choosing that option. It is very helpful.

I also have become more confident and value money far more now. Now I know how much it costs for me to live each month. I know how long each dollar saved will support me if I lose my income entirely and see this as freedom! 

It has not been easy and I still feel depressed like today when I am worried about my future and not sleeping enough. But I wanted to write this post to remind myself of how much I’ve grown from the experience and that whatever happens it is just another opportunity for me to learn new skills and take more control and responsibility!

I have been humbled and when I am back fully on my feet again I will not take my money for granted. I will not let myself spend more than 20% of the money that goes above my new monthly cost number. The other 80% will be saved and invested in something to secure my future and help me become less frightened and scared. 

If you are going through hard times I hope you find a way to see the light and grow stronger and more confident as a result in a way that can be maintained long term!

,personalfinance,"Due to COVID-19, my internship has recently been converted into a remote internship and I no longer needed to live in New York over the summer. I contacted my landlord about canceling my lease and she said that she could make special accommodations because of the pandemic. She offered to terminate my lease a month early, which means I would no longer be liable for 1 month's rent -- awesome. 

However, in the early termination contract she sent over, I noticed there was no mention of the security deposit. Wanting to be safe than sorry, I didn't sign the contract and instead emailed my landlord back a simple ""hey, when can I expect a refund of my security deposit?"" She says, ""sorry, we can only refund a portion of your deposit, and only if  someone re-rents the apartment for the month that you backed out of."" 

I was bummed. I'd be saving money by canceling one month's rent, but my security deposit was roughly equivalent to a month's worth of rent, so essentially I'd be back to square one. I thought that there might be a way out of this, so I dug up the original 43-page lease agreement and skimmed the contract until I found the clauses on early termination and the security deposit. I pointed out to my landlord that early termination was not outlined as a reason to withhold the security deposit. After 36 hours of no-response from her (she had been responding every 1-2 hours up until this point), she simply followed up with a new version of the early termination contract that stated I would receive my security deposit back and said ""Sorry for the miscommunication.

Vet Bills: This includes surgery required right after we got her for a root canal. A couple of appointments for broken dew claws (she was a very active dog in her youth, still is :), and a visit to the dog ER for some major vomiting/diarrhea issues about a year ago. Other than that this is the cost of yearly checkups/shots and heartworm medication.

Food/Toys/Supplies: The majority of this is for food and frontline from Costco. I found that their food agrees with my dog and I can get a large bag of the blue buffalo knockoff stuff for $35. She needs about 1 bag of food a month. Frontline is also dirt cheap there at $35ish for a 6 month supply. This also includes some toys, and the price of a few dog beds. Usually a bed lasts about 2 years it seems in her kennel before she scratches it apart.

Boarding/Kennels/Rover: Costs to board her when she cant stay with friends/family. We usually take one big week long vacation a year where she gets boarded. Other than that its maybe 2-3 over nights a year on top of our vacation. Rover we also found to be cheaper/closer once we found someone in our neighborhood. The dog also seems to like it a lot more.

The rest of the expenses in the list are pretty rink-a-dink one off things. Random toys/treats, some training costs from when we first got her, the initial adoption cost. The cost for PetPlan was after I was spending a ton of money on her at the vet in the first year. I thought dog insurance would be worth the cost. I quickly learned that it isnt. They have loopholes big enough to drive a semi through, and I see no way to justify the expense unless you have a pure breed dog that you know for certain will have high vet costs.

Please feel free to ask any questions! I love tracking my expenses and personal finance.

,personalfinance,"Hey Guys,

So I have recently been put on temporary secondment at a different department at the same company I work at. I had two weeks of training that were work from home and the role itself hasn't been TOO bad, but it's mainly been the people.

I don't know why, but the only person I really have jived well with are people on the same secondment from my old department and the managers of this department (which is all that should matter) but the other co-workers who are in this department already have been acting like complete stooges towards me.

I'm a relatively quiet guy, but I have been told by people from my old department that I'm pretty likable, easy going and have a good first impression, but I am being constantly berated by these people in my new department. I could understand if it was constructive criticism (as I am new to the position and am not perfect), but having people calling a retard for making an easily fixable mistake just doesn't seem on.

I finish this secondment in about a month and a half and they are going to ask me if I would like to stay on or go back to my old department. The extra position pays an 12k per annum (68k per year), which is a sizable amount.

,personalfinance,"My dad passed away a couple weeks ago from cancer. My mom is still here and we are trying to figure out how he's been paying bills. For example, we're not sure how he was paying for gas and electric. 

Do we just call the companies and ask them what account he's been paying from? 

Mostly everything is on auto-pay (either monthly or quarterly), but he had a crazy amount of bank accounts so it's difficult to figure out where he was paying from for a lot of our services. Also he had a ton of CC debt (I read we are not responsible for that). They closed all his accounts and my mom never did finances before so she doesn't have a CC or bank to pay any bills on her own for now. 

She keeps crying talking about how we could lose our house, etc. but I told her don't worry. I have about 6 figures available personally and said I'd help if needed but she thinks I shouldn't have to and doesn't want me to, but I obviously will if worst comes to worst.

My mom is still here and we are trying to figure out how he&amp;#39;s been paying bills. For example, we&amp;#39;re not sure how he was paying for gas and electric. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we just call the companies and ask them what account he&amp;#39;s been paying from? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly everything is on auto-pay (either monthly or quarterly), but he had a crazy amount of bank accounts so it&amp;#39;s difficult to figure out where he was paying from for a lot of our services. Also he had a ton of CC debt (I read we are not responsible for that). They closed all his accounts and my mom never did finances before so she doesn&amp;#39;t have a CC or bank to pay any bills on her own for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She keeps crying talking about how we could lose our house, etc. but I told her don&amp;#39;t worry. I have about 6 figures available personally and said I&amp;#39;d help if needed but she thinks I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to and doesn&amp;#39;t want me to, but I obviously will if worst comes to worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was also a hoarder, so his office is filled with hundreds of folders with papers dating back to the early 2000&amp;#39;s, very overwhelming to go through. &lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Given the number of requests we've had to post a megathread along with the volume of similar threads being submitted, we're consolidating future general discussion on this topic here.

**We will continue to make updates to this post.**

# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# If you lose your job or are at risk of losing your job

Please read the **[Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)**.

**If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.**

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Travel

If you have travel planned, read *[Coronavirus &amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel)* from Clark Howard.

Also see the [megathread on /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/) for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will continue to make updates to this post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments""&gt;https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don&amp;#39;t wreck yourself checking every five minutes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior years&amp;#39; tax returns are being used to calculate each person&amp;#39;s stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you&amp;#39;ll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will I get paid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran&amp;#39;s Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I am a dependent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels bad, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can&amp;#39;t be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;#39;s important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this just an &amp;quot;advance&amp;quot; on my tax refund?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Assuming you&amp;#39;re eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html""&gt;this article from CNN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/""&gt;Washington Post has a similar statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know""&gt;In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;If you lose your job or are at risk of losing your job&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/""&gt;Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stock market turbulence&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very natural to be feel concerned when there&amp;#39;s a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it&amp;#39;s important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. &lt;a href=""https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns""&gt;Between 1980 and 2017, there were &lt;strong&gt;11 market corrections and 8 bear markets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;amp;t=4""&gt;Trying to time the market rarely turns out well&lt;/a&gt; and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone&amp;#39;s predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/""&gt;Stick to your plan and stay the course.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Warren Buffett: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;amp;t=24""&gt;&amp;quot;to buy or sell on current news is just crazy&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make an emotional decision, don&amp;#39;t try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You&amp;#39;re investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals""&gt;Budget your money and reduce expenses.&lt;/a&gt; Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund""&gt;Build an emergency fund.&lt;/a&gt; An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don&amp;#39;t touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you&amp;#39;re in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics""&gt;&amp;quot;How to handle $&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can&amp;#39;t make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can&amp;#39;t pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more good stuff you should be doing in this &lt;a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle""&gt;video from Bogleheads&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index""&gt;PF wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Travel&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have travel planned, read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=""https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel""&gt;Coronavirus &amp;amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from Clark Howard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see the &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/""&gt;megathread on /r/travel&lt;/a&gt; for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Refinancing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/""&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering&lt;/a&gt;, but if you don&amp;#39;t have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private student loans are not affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/""&gt;If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your loan is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=""https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/""&gt;https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/&lt;/a&gt; for more information and updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930""&gt;Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers""&gt;The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State deadlines are not affected by the extension&lt;/strong&gt;, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). &lt;a href=""https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf""&gt;The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states&amp;#39; filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break""&gt;The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details and &lt;strong&gt;numerous warnings&lt;/strong&gt; about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance," Recently I saw my future income rising and decided to lock in a lease agreement to rent a nicer apartment. I was doing well in my job and a friend's small business I had been helping for many months was beginning to turn over enough revenue to create a side stream of income. 

However what ended up happening was sales began to slump at the end of last year and the amount I had earned from my main job began to decrease. The business I had been supporting was also put into a position where it could no longer pay me for the work I was doing to help keep it running.

All of a sudden the amount of money I was spending became more than the amount I was earning and I realized very quickly that I had made a mistake to increase the amount I was paying in rent. 

I began to feel very depressed and calculated that if I went on spending what I was currently spending with my new income I would be burning over $1000 dollars a month.

I was in a lease for 10 more months and it would cost me over $3000 to break lease early and many more associated costs if I was going to move out of my apartment. Uh OH! There was only one option. I had to REALLY tighten the belt if I was going to survive this storm I had entered into.

Using the spreadsheet I had used to figure out how much I was going to lose each month I went in deeper to understand not what I was spending all up but what I was spending individually. The big things were eating out, alcohol at bars and Ubers, and I also realized that I was spending about $40 a month on subscriptions too. I began to cut all of these things out, by cooking more at home and not eating out anymore. Not drinking at bars anymore and cancelling all my subscriptions and reading books from online instead. I also began to catch public transport or walk instead of taking Ubers.

In my first month I spent $500 less, The exercise has made me go through all my expenses and now I understand how much I spend on everything each month. When COVID hit it was like I was already adjusted! Since COVID I am now spending Over $750 a month LESS! When I think of spending for convenience I think about earning that money through not choosing that option. It is very helpful.

I also have become more confident and value money far more now. Now I know how much it costs for me to live each month. I know how long each dollar saved will support me if I lose my income entirely and see this as freedom! 

It has not been easy and I still feel depressed like today when I am worried about my future and not sleeping enough. But I wanted to write this post to remind myself of how much I’ve grown from the experience and that whatever happens it is just another opportunity for me to learn new skills and take more control and responsibility!

I have been humbled and when I am back fully on my feet again I will not take my money for granted. I will not let myself spend more than 20% of the money that goes above my new monthly cost number. The other 80% will be saved and invested in something to secure my future and help me become less frightened and scared. 

If you are going through hard times I hope you find a way to see the light and grow stronger and more confident as a result in a way that can be maintained long term!

,personalfinance,"Due to COVID-19, my internship has recently been converted into a remote internship and I no longer needed to live in New York over the summer. I contacted my landlord about canceling my lease and she said that she could make special accommodations because of the pandemic. She offered to terminate my lease a month early, which means I would no longer be liable for 1 month's rent -- awesome. 

However, in the early termination contract she sent over, I noticed there was no mention of the security deposit.

I was bummed. I'd be saving money by canceling one month's rent, but my security deposit was roughly equivalent to a month's worth of rent, so essentially I'd be back to square one. I thought that there might be a way out of this, so I dug up the original 43-page lease agreement and skimmed the contract until I found the clauses on early termination and the security deposit. I pointed out to my landlord that early termination was not outlined as a reason to withhold the security deposit.

I thought I would add some perspective with a longer term look at dog expenses. I've got a full image breakdown here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/G60VYi0)
And an image for the dog tax here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/Z372VAq)

Total Costs - $13,841.83
Notable Costs:  
 Vet Bills - $3705.15
   Food/Toys/Supplies - $4948.25
   Boarding/Kennels/Rover - $1863.59

Vet Bills: This includes surgery required right after we got her for a root canal. A couple of appointments for broken dew claws (she was a very active dog in her youth, still is :), and a visit to the dog ER for some major vomiting/diarrhea issues about a year ago. Other than that this is the cost of yearly checkups/shots and heartworm medication.

Food/Toys/Supplies: The majority of this is for food and frontline from Costco. I found that their food agrees with my dog and I can get a large bag of the blue buffalo knockoff stuff for $35. She needs about 1 bag of food a month. Frontline is also dirt cheap there at $35ish for a 6 month supply. This also includes some toys, and the price of a few dog beds. Usually a bed lasts about 2 years it seems in her kennel before she scratches it apart.

Boarding/Kennels/Rover: Costs to board her when she cant stay with friends/family. We usually take one big week long vacation a year where she gets boarded. Other than that its maybe 2-3 over nights a year on top of our vacation. Rover we also found to be cheaper/closer once we found someone in our neighborhood. The dog also seems to like it a lot more.

The rest of the expenses in the list are pretty rink-a-dink one off things. Random toys/treats, some training costs from when we first got her, the initial adoption cost. The cost for PetPlan was after I was spending a ton of money on her at the vet in the first year. I thought dog insurance would be worth the cost. I quickly learned that it isnt. They have loopholes big enough to drive a semi through, and I see no way to justify the expense unless you have a pure breed dog that you know for certain will have high vet costs.

,personalfinance,"Hey Guys,

So I have recently been put on temporary secondment at a different department at the same company I work at. I had two weeks of training that were work from home and the role itself hasn't been TOO bad, but it's mainly been the people.

I don't know why, but the only person I really have jived well with are people on the same secondment from my old department and the managers of this department (which is all that should matter) but the other co-workers who are in this department already have been acting like complete stooges towards me.

I'm a relatively quiet guy, but I have been told by people from my old department that I'm pretty likable, easy going and have a good first impression, but I am being constantly berated by these people in my new department. I could understand if it was constructive criticism (as I am new to the position and am not perfect), but having people calling a retard for making an easily fixable mistake just doesn't seem on.

I finish this secondment in about a month and a half and they are going to ask me if I would like to stay on or go back to my old department. The extra position pays an 12k per annum (68k per year), which is a sizable amount.

Any helps appreciated.",t2_12pm6r,False,,0,False,Bigger paycheck or my sanity?,[],r/personalfinance,False,6,Employment,0,False,t3_gfrvmr,False,light,0.82,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Employment,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588967915.0,text,6,,,text,self.personalfinance,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Guys,&lt;/p&gt;

I living rent free for now and should be able to save half of my income every month.  I think the target I’m aiming for is around 150k to buy the boat and live for at least a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to start saving for retirement if possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from negotiating a higher salary every year does anyone got any tips on how to achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;

- my credit score is between 650-700 and has been stuck since I rarely use my credit cards at all.

I want to save until I have a little more than I can put down as a down payment on a house with my partner. 
By that time, I'm definitely hoping I'll have an income of about 40-50k/yr. 

I also would like to start investing in ""cheap"" index funds. I feel I need to learn more before jumping into that pool though.

,personalfinance,"Given the number of requests we've had to post a megathread along with the volume of similar threads being submitted, we're consolidating future general discussion on this topic here.

**We will continue to make updates to this post.**

# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# If you lose your job or are at risk of losing your job

Please read the **[Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)**.

**If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.**

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Travel

If you have travel planned, read *[Coronavirus &amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel)* from Clark Howard.

Also see the [megathread on /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/) for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html""&gt;this article from CNN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/""&gt;Washington Post has a similar statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know""&gt;In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stock market turbulence&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very natural to be feel concerned when there&amp;#39;s a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it&amp;#39;s important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. &lt;a href=""https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns""&gt;Between 1980 and 2017, there were &lt;strong&gt;11 market corrections and 8 bear markets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;amp;t=4""&gt;Trying to time the market rarely turns out well&lt;/a&gt; and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone&amp;#39;s predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/""&gt;Stick to your plan and stay the course.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Warren Buffett: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;amp;t=24""&gt;&amp;quot;to buy or sell on current news is just crazy&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make an emotional decision, don&amp;#39;t try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You&amp;#39;re investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals""&gt;Budget your money and reduce expenses.&lt;/a&gt; Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund""&gt;Build an emergency fund.&lt;/a&gt; An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don&amp;#39;t touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you&amp;#39;re in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics""&gt;&amp;quot;How to handle $&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can&amp;#39;t make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can&amp;#39;t pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more good stuff you should be doing in this &lt;a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle""&gt;video from Bogleheads&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index""&gt;PF wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Travel&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have travel planned, read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=""https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel""&gt;Coronavirus &amp;amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from Clark Howard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see the &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/""&gt;megathread on /r/travel&lt;/a&gt; for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Refinancing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/""&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering&lt;/a&gt;, but if you don&amp;#39;t have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private student loans are not affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/""&gt;If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your loan is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=""https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/""&gt;https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/&lt;/a&gt; for more information and updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930""&gt;Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers""&gt;The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State deadlines are not affected by the extension&lt;/strong&gt;, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). &lt;a href=""https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf""&gt;The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states&amp;#39; filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break""&gt;The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details and &lt;strong&gt;numerous warnings&lt;/strong&gt; about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance," Recently I saw my future income rising and decided to lock in a lease agreement to rent a nicer apartment. I was doing well in my job and a friend's small business I had been helping for many months was beginning to turn over enough revenue to create a side stream of income. 

However what ended up happening was sales began to slump at the end of last year and the amount I had earned from my main job began to decrease. The business I had been supporting was also put into a position where it could no longer pay me for the work I was doing to help keep it running.

All of a sudden the amount of money I was spending became more than the amount I was earning and I realized very quickly that I had made a mistake to increase the amount I was paying in rent. 

I began to feel very depressed and calculated that if I went on spending what I was currently spending with my new income I would be burning over $1000 dollars a month.

I was in a lease for 10 more months and it would cost me over $3000 to break lease early and many more associated costs if I was going to move out of my apartment. Uh OH! There was only one option. I had to REALLY tighten the belt if I was going to survive this storm I had entered into.

Using the spreadsheet I had used to figure out how much I was going to lose each month I went in deeper to understand not what I was spending all up but what I was spending individually. The big things were eating out, alcohol at bars and Ubers, and I also realized that I was spending about $40 a month on subscriptions too. I began to cut all of these things out, by cooking more at home and not eating out anymore. Not drinking at bars anymore and cancelling all my subscriptions and reading books from online instead. I also began to catch public transport or walk instead of taking Ubers.

In my first month I spent $500 less, The exercise has made me go through all my expenses and now I understand how much I spend on everything each month. When COVID hit it was like I was already adjusted! Since COVID I am now spending Over $750 a month LESS! When I think of spending for convenience I think about earning that money through not choosing that option. It is very helpful.

I also have become more confident and value money far more now. Now I know how much it costs for me to live each month. I know how long each dollar saved will support me if I lose my income entirely and see this as freedom! 

It has not been easy and I still feel depressed like today when I am worried about my future and not sleeping enough. But I wanted to write this post to remind myself of how much I’ve grown from the experience and that whatever happens it is just another opportunity for me to learn new skills and take more control and responsibility!

I have been humbled and when I am back fully on my feet again I will not take my money for granted. I will not let myself spend more than 20% of the money that goes above my new monthly cost number. The other 80% will be saved and invested in something to secure my future and help me become less frightened and scared. 

If you are going through hard times I hope you find a way to see the light and grow stronger and more confident as a result in a way that can be maintained long term!

&lt;p&gt;If you are going through hard times I hope you find a way to see the light and grow stronger and more confident as a result in a way that can be maintained long term!&lt;/p&gt;

I thought I would add some perspective with a longer term look at dog expenses. I've got a full image breakdown here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/G60VYi0)
And an image for the dog tax here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/Z372VAq)

Total Costs - $13,841.83
Notable Costs:  
 Vet Bills - $3705.15
   Food/Toys/Supplies - $4948.25
   Boarding/Kennels/Rover - $1863.59

Vet Bills: This includes surgery required right after we got her for a root canal. A couple of appointments for broken dew claws (she was a very active dog in her youth, still is :), and a visit to the dog ER for some major vomiting/diarrhea issues about a year ago. Other than that this is the cost of yearly checkups/shots and heartworm medication.

Food/Toys/Supplies: The majority of this is for food and frontline from Costco. I found that their food agrees with my dog and I can get a large bag of the blue buffalo knockoff stuff for $35. She needs about 1 bag of food a month. Frontline is also dirt cheap there at $35ish for a 6 month supply. This also includes some toys, and the price of a few dog beds. Usually a bed lasts about 2 years it seems in her kennel before she scratches it apart.

Boarding/Kennels/Rover: Costs to board her when she cant stay with friends/family. We usually take one big week long vacation a year where she gets boarded. Other than that its maybe 2-3 over nights a year on top of our vacation. Rover we also found to be cheaper/closer once we found someone in our neighborhood. The dog also seems to like it a lot more.

The rest of the expenses in the list are pretty rink-a-dink one off things. Random toys/treats, some training costs from when we first got her, the initial adoption cost. The cost for PetPlan was after I was spending a ton of money on her at the vet in the first year. I thought dog insurance would be worth the cost. I quickly learned that it isnt. They have loopholes big enough to drive a semi through, and I see no way to justify the expense unless you have a pure breed dog that you know for certain will have high vet costs.

So I have recently been put on temporary secondment at a different department at the same company I work at. I had two weeks of training that were work from home and the role itself hasn't been TOO bad, but it's mainly been the people.

I don't know why, but the only person I really have jived well with are people on the same secondment from my old department and the managers of this department (which is all that should matter) but the other co-workers who are in this department already have been acting like complete stooges towards me.

I'm a relatively quiet guy, but I have been told by people from my old department that I'm pretty likable, easy going and have a good first impression, but I am being constantly berated by these people in my new department. I could understand if it was constructive criticism (as I am new to the position and am not perfect), but having people calling a retard for making an easily fixable mistake just doesn't seem on.

I finish this secondment in about a month and a half and they are going to ask me if I would like to stay on or go back to my old department. The extra position pays an 12k per annum (68k per year), which is a sizable amount.

But I started working at current employer I was 30 days late on a (5 car payments) it was hard to catch up on the loan when I had lost my old job. But I never went longer than 30 days late. I have paid off my debt other than &lt;20k student loans and I have a car note of 20k. I have about 10K or so for a down payment on a house. 

My wife is a stay at home mom. We have two young children. Until recently she had no credit history, she had no job so we didn’t think it would be good for her to have a card. I’m Considering asking a family member with good credit to have her added to an AU on a card. We opened 3 credit cards in her name to increase her credit line to roughly $1200. Her credit is now climbing (620+), but how much would her credit matter due to the fact she has no income?

Her credit is now climbing (620+), but how much would her credit matter due to the fact she has no income? &lt;/p&gt;

Retirement accounts around $150k, plus a pension if those still exist in 40 years

- Only debt I have is my car ~$11,000 (9.5 % apr) I&amp;#39;m working on refinancing to about ~4% within the next month.
- my credit score is between 650-700 and has been stuck since I rarely use my credit cards at all. 
- I have $5k in my savings 
- I try save at least 550 a month from my pay (I&amp;#39;m thinking to increase this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to save until I have a little more than I can put down as a down payment on a house with my partner. 
By that time, I&amp;#39;m definitely hoping I&amp;#39;ll have an income of about 40-50k/yr. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also would like to start investing in &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; index funds. I feel I need to learn more before jumping into that pool though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions: 
1. Any general advice on what I can do achieve my goals here? (I know getting a better job will help of course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are index funds a better idea than stocks for someone in my position? Or should I not be concerned about that right now?&lt;/li&gt;

# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# If you lose your job or are at risk of losing your job

Please read the **[Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)**.

**If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.**

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Travel

If you have travel planned, read *[Coronavirus &amp; Your Finances: What to Know and Do](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel)* from Clark Howard.

Also see the [megathread on /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/) for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

&lt;li&gt;Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private student loans are not affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/""&gt;If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your loan is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930""&gt;Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers""&gt;The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State deadlines are not affected by the extension&lt;/strong&gt;, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). &lt;a href=""https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf""&gt;The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states&amp;#39; filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break""&gt;The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details and &lt;strong&gt;numerous warnings&lt;/strong&gt; about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance," Recently I saw my future income rising and decided to lock in a lease agreement to rent a nicer apartment. I was doing well in my job and a friend's small business I had been helping for many months was beginning to turn over enough revenue to create a side stream of income. 

However what ended up happening was sales began to slump at the end of last year and the amount I had earned from my main job began to decrease. The business I had been supporting was also put into a position where it could no longer pay me for the work I was doing to help keep it running.

All of a sudden the amount of money I was spending became more than the amount I was earning and I realized very quickly that I had made a mistake to increase the amount I was paying in rent. 

I began to feel very depressed and calculated that if I went on spending what I was currently spending with my new income I would be burning over $1000 dollars a month.

I was in a lease for 10 more months and it would cost me over $3000 to break lease early and many more associated costs if I was going to move out of my apartment. Uh OH! There was only one option. I had to REALLY tighten the belt if I was going to survive this storm I had entered into.

Using the spreadsheet I had used to figure out how much I was going to lose each month I went in deeper to understand not what I was spending all up but what I was spending individually. The big things were eating out, alcohol at bars and Ubers, and I also realized that I was spending about $40 a month on subscriptions too. I began to cut all of these things out, by cooking more at home and not eating out anymore. Not drinking at bars anymore and cancelling all my subscriptions and reading books from online instead. I also began to catch public transport or walk instead of taking Ubers.

In my first month I spent $500 less, The exercise has made me go through all my expenses and now I understand how much I spend on everything each month. When COVID hit it was like I was already adjusted! Since COVID I am now spending Over $750 a month LESS! When I think of spending for convenience I think about earning that money through not choosing that option. It is very helpful.

I also have become more confident and value money far more now. Now I know how much it costs for me to live each month. I know how long each dollar saved will support me if I lose my income entirely and see this as freedom! 

It has not been easy and I still feel depressed like today when I am worried about my future and not sleeping enough. But I wanted to write this post to remind myself of how much I’ve grown from the experience and that whatever happens it is just another opportunity for me to learn new skills and take more control and responsibility!

I have been humbled and when I am back fully on my feet again I will not take my money for granted. I will not let myself spend more than 20% of the money that goes above my new monthly cost number. The other 80% will be saved and invested in something to secure my future and help me become less frightened and scared. 

If you are going through hard times I hope you find a way to see the light and grow stronger and more confident as a result in a way that can be maintained long term!

&lt;p&gt;I would love to put down about 40k-50k on a down payment in a couple of years but would also like to get our debt out of the way. We have auto and student loans totaling around 80k and with the snowball method, I feel we could knock it out fairly quickly. I also want to start investing since all we have currently is my 401k that is only up to what my employer matches. I want to max out our HSA as it could essentially be used similarly to a Roth IRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate paying rent and not building equity, and although there are perks to renting, it just hurts my soul. I feel weighed down by debt and want to get it out of the way asap. I feel we also need to start thinking about our future and investing more as we are already in our late 20s. Which do I pursue? I feel they&amp;#39;re all equally important.

I thought I would add some perspective with a longer term look at dog expenses. I've got a full image breakdown here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/G60VYi0)
And an image for the dog tax here:
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/Z372VAq)

Total Costs - $13,841.83
Notable Costs:  
 Vet Bills - $3705.15
   Food/Toys/Supplies - $4948.25
   Boarding/Kennels/Rover - $1863.59

Vet Bills: This includes surgery required right after we got her for a root canal. A couple of appointments for broken dew claws (she was a very active dog in her youth, still is :), and a visit to the dog ER for some major vomiting/diarrhea issues about a year ago. Other than that this is the cost of yearly checkups/shots and heartworm medication.

Food/Toys/Supplies: The majority of this is for food and frontline from Costco. I found that their food agrees with my dog and I can get a large bag of the blue buffalo knockoff stuff for $35. She needs about 1 bag of food a month. Frontline is also dirt cheap there at $35ish for a 6 month supply. This also includes some toys, and the price of a few dog beds. Usually a bed lasts about 2 years it seems in her kennel before she scratches it apart.

Boarding/Kennels/Rover: Costs to board her when she cant stay with friends/family. We usually take one big week long vacation a year where she gets boarded. Other than that its maybe 2-3 over nights a year on top of our vacation. Rover we also found to be cheaper/closer once we found someone in our neighborhood. The dog also seems to like it a lot more.

The rest of the expenses in the list are pretty rink-a-dink one off things. Random toys/treats, some training costs from when we first got her, the initial adoption cost. The cost for PetPlan was after I was spending a ton of money on her at the vet in the first year. I thought dog insurance would be worth the cost. I quickly learned that it isnt. They have loopholes big enough to drive a semi through, and I see no way to justify the expense unless you have a pure breed dog that you know for certain will have high vet costs.

Please feel free to ask any questions! I love tracking my expenses and personal finance.

I contacted my landlord about canceling my lease and she said that she could make special accommodations because of the pandemic. She offered to terminate my lease a month early, which means I would no longer be liable for 1 month's rent -- awesome.

I pointed out to my landlord that early termination was not outlined as a reason to withhold the security deposit. After 36 hours of no-response from her (she had been responding every 1-2 hours up until this point), she simply followed up with a new version of the early termination contract that stated I would receive my security deposit back and said ""Sorry for the miscommunication.

So I have recently been put on temporary secondment at a different department at the same company I work at. I had two weeks of training that were work from home and the role itself hasn't been TOO bad, but it's mainly been the people.

I don't know why, but the only person I really have jived well with are people on the same secondment from my old department and the managers of this department (which is all that should matter) but the other co-workers who are in this department already have been acting like complete stooges towards me.

I'm a relatively quiet guy, but I have been told by people from my old department that I'm pretty likable, easy going and have a good first impression, but I am being constantly berated by these people in my new department. I could understand if it was constructive criticism (as I am new to the position and am not perfect), but having people calling a retard for making an easily fixable mistake just doesn't seem on.

I finish this secondment in about a month and a half and they are going to ask me if I would like to stay on or go back to my old department. The extra position pays an 12k per annum (68k per year), which is a sizable amount.

Married couple, kids someday. 30 years old. 

$270k income last year. She is tech salary, I am self employed so this can go up or down by maybe $50k per year due to my work schedule (but last year was a safe average)

Additional FAANG stock vesting of around $40k/year

Retirement accounts around $150k, plus a pension if those still exist in 40 years

$300 month car payment ($12k left)
$200 month federal student loan ($16k left)
No other debt

,personalfinance,"Title is the tl,dr. What's the easiest, most cost effective way to amend my 2018 return? I used H&amp;R Block Online originally, free through the IRS if I remember right. I have all paperwork and documents either saved to file, or printed out and within reach. 

Background, in case it matters: 

Somehow the Change of Address I filed with USPS didn't catch this one. The family member living at my old place just told me Sunday, ""Oh, I have some mail for you."" It's an interest statement from some unclaimed property I claimed in 2018. (This envelope has been sitting in their house since Jan '19.) Because it's on a real 1099, and it's from the LA Dept of Rev, I'm sure a copy was issued to the IRS.

I feel, obviously I have to file an amended return. Otherwise the IRS will catch up to it in a few years and it'll be a lot worse for me. In addition, I'm worried about an eventual audit. Even though my household makes less than $75k/yr, I have all sorts of income streams like Uber, bank account churning, MTurk, eBay, Swagbucks, and even selling crypto from promotional offers.

What&amp;#39;s the easiest, most cost effective way to amend my 2018 return? I used H&amp;amp;R Block Online originally, free through the IRS if I remember right. I have all paperwork and documents either saved to file, or printed out and within reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background, in case it matters: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow the Change of Address I filed with USPS didn&amp;#39;t catch this one. The family member living at my old place just told me Sunday, &amp;quot;Oh, I have some mail for you.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s an interest statement from some unclaimed property I claimed in 2018. (This envelope has been sitting in their house since Jan &amp;#39;19.) Because it&amp;#39;s on a real 1099, and it&amp;#39;s from the LA Dept of Rev, I&amp;#39;m sure a copy was issued to the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel, obviously I have to file an amended return. Otherwise the IRS will catch up to it in a few years and it&amp;#39;ll be a lot worse for me. In addition, I&amp;#39;m worried about an eventual audit. Even though my household makes less than $75k/yr, I have all sorts of income streams like Uber, bank account churning, MTurk, eBay, Swagbucks, and even selling crypto from promotional offers. I&amp;#39;d hate for them to look at this 1099 (for only $10 and change!) and say, &amp;quot;I wonder what else he isn&amp;#39;t reporting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Have read too much of others post and thought I'd ask my own. My Wife (F,23) earns roughly $60,000K a year, has held the position for 6 months. I on the other hand, (M, 24) earn 105,000K a year, I've been in my current position for a year. We live in Northern California.

We both recently graduated from university and have a combined $28K in student debt. 5K for me, and 23K for her.

Credit details:

1. Mine (679) During college I went late on a credit card payment 3 times.
2. Hers (685) No late payments, just a small window of credit history

3 ) I paid off my auto loan last month and got a pay for delete collection item removed last month from my credit report.

4) We have no other debt.

Savings:

We have $10,000 in our robinhood which I aim to pull out soon.

We also have $50,000K in a cash low interest savings account.

We have been living rent free for the past year and have managed to save $65,000 (50K for me and about 15K for her) in about 11 months time. As of right now, I am saving 5K a month and she is saving 3K a month.

Around time of purchasing house we should be about 70K in cash savings.

Downpayment:

I think putting 5% down on a 500K house would be $25K plus closing costs of say $10K is reasonable. We should also be comfortable with 6 months of emergency funds.

The issues:

We both have outstanding debt, low employment history and low credit scores. In addition, we plan to buy this house in another state, Colorado, I would have an automatic work transfer to Boulder (I keep the same salary)and she has been interviewing and it seems she could have an offer by the end of this month, she will be increasing her salary by about 20k to 30K.

We are looking to move to Colorado from California, aim is to buy a house around July end (want to see how Covid affects everything) We would work remotely from California prior to move.

Is this realistic?

Edit:

1. Big reason on moving: We are both very nature driven, ski a lot, hike extensively with our dog and this would be the ideal area for that. We also plan to do graduate studies (masters) and our field of focus is for me (programming for scientific research) and her (materials engineer) and the boulder/denver area is great for all of the research centers, job opps in our field, as well as CU Boulder for both of our further studies.
2. It's the Arvada area in Colorado, we have family over Longmont, Boulder and Aspen (visited the area (Boulder, Longmont) multiple times in the last year). So yes, we do know the area and more importantly, the area fits our life style quite well. Also, our jobs will most likely be in Boulder, so the commute would be around 20 mins to 50 mins (depending on traffic) on the days we do go into office.
3. Paying off debt: My aim is to pay off the 5K in student debt from a gift from my dad of 2.5k and 2.5k of my own money in the next month or two (it's 0% interest currently and would be good to just get rid of it). As for her, she aims to pay off 5K by next month and wants to pay the rest of over the next year.

Why I want to move now: I am really tired of California as is she. We also have her family their (who I get along really well with).",t2_4rbn45r6,False,,0,False,"Moving out of state, is this income and credit history/score enough ?",[],r/personalfinance,False,6,Housing,0,False,t3_gfcpxi,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Housing,False,1,,False,,1588885460.0,,[],{},,True,,1588906594.0,text,6,,,text,self.personalfinance,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have read too much of others post and thought I&amp;#39;d ask my own. My Wife (F,23) earns roughly $60,000K a year, has held the position for 6 months. I on the other hand, (M, 24) earn 105,000K a year, I&amp;#39;ve been in my current position for a year. We live in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both recently graduated from university and have a combined $28K in student debt. 5K for me, and 23K for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mine (679) During college I went late on a credit card payment 3 times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hers (685) No late payments, just a small window of credit history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 ) I paid off my auto loan last month and got a pay for delete collection item removed last month from my credit report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) We have no other debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have $10,000 in our robinhood which I aim to pull out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have $50,000K in a cash low interest savings account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been living rent free for the past year and have managed to save $65,000 (50K for me and about 15K for her) in about 11 months time. As of right now, I am saving 5K a month and she is saving 3K a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around time of purchasing house we should be about 70K in cash savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downpayment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think putting 5% down on a 500K house would be $25K plus closing costs of say $10K is reasonable. We should also be comfortable with 6 months of emergency funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both have outstanding debt, low employment history and low credit scores. In addition, we plan to buy this house in another state, Colorado, I would have an automatic work transfer to Boulder (I keep the same salary)and she has been interviewing and it seems she could have an offer by the end of this month, she will be increasing her salary by about 20k to 30K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking to move to Colorado from California, aim is to buy a house around July end (want to see how Covid affects everything) We would work remotely from California prior to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this realistic?&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hello there. I recently started working full time and wanted to help my family with their home mortgage.

When the stimulus money came in we put all of it into the monthly payment to shave off more from our principle balance.  There's currently an 8% interest, so a bit goes to that, and then there's the escrow. I was under the assumption this was a set amount being charged every month for property taxes/insurance, but the amount that automatically went into escrow this month nearly tripled when we paid a larger monthly sum, which was alarming to me. My family is just as perplexed. They know just enough English to get by, so they accept that this is just how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? Why does this happen? Thank you in advance for your help.

,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm trying to figure out how best to invest some monthly recurring income. I've already looked at the flow chart on options, but, still feel unsure, and I just want to hear some people who have been in similar positions. 

About me, 40, 3 kids, divorced, no debt minus house, pay some child support / alimony, have 4 months of emergency funds in high yield savings, doing max contributions to 401k, high earner, generally pretty frugal for day to day life. I'm not going to put money away for kids college at this time, as I am behind on where I think I should be for retirement. 

I'm trying to figure out where I should put these extra funds (1 - 2k /month). 

A really big part of me says, buy real estate. I don't mind the idea of being a land lord. I could see myself doing this full time while unemployed later on in life. I like the idea of building passive income + possibly building equity / wealth with it. I live in a place that is a renters market and will be for some time. But, after this pandemic, and the likelyhood of having to keep leverage on myself with a mortgage to purchase said rental, I'm wondering if that's the right choice. I could likely get into rentals cash only if I wanted to wait 3 or 4 years and find the right deal and kept saving. But, does that equal lost oppurtunity? And given the lack of want to carry a mortgage, the accruing of these assets is a long term thing it feels like. 

OR

Should I say screw it to all those things, and setup a separate brokerage account and start diversifying that way. I'm pretty green to this, and I'm still working on getting my understanding of how to approach this now that I have doubts about my initial plan. Would this be an easy way to do the same things above? Pros/cons? No idea here yet.

OR

Do I pay off the house? I like the appeal of it where I'm only on the hook for taxes, repairs, and living expenses in life. But, I don't need this size house for the rest of my life. My kids will all be adults in 10ish years and hopefully out of the house. I would think I would maybe downsize. So this doesn't seem ideal. And I don't think there is a definitive win or lose in this category to really push me to do it or not other than the emotional debt free want.

,personalfinance,"I don't know if I should post this in r/tooafraidtoask, this sub seems the right place. 

I see a lot of people in this sub talking about loans on credit cards, wondering if they should pay their credit card loan of putting the same money in an account etc. How does that work? It seems very different that how it works where I live in France. 

How it works here : you have a credit card, you spend the money you actually have in your bank account liked to the card. You can be authorised to go under 0€ left in your account but we're talking about 200-500€, if you go above ('under' would be more appropriate) you're paying heavy interests (to prevent you doing it, regular loan's interests being maybe 10 times less), and if it's too often the bank will just take back the credit card or automatically decline payment if your balance isn't sufficient. 

There is no such thing as ""paying credit card loan"", the bank will just prevent you go too deep without asking for your opinion. When you get your salary, if you're balance is negative you can't choose to pay your due to the bank or not, if you're at -500 and getting 200, then you're now at -300, period. 

As a result absolutely everyone has a credit card without much of consumerism problem. Teenagers have a CB that's declined without proper balance, limited in the amount that can be spent/withdrawd per day and per week and per month.

,personalfinance,"Have read too much of others post and thought I'd ask my own. My Wife (F,23) earns roughly $60,000K a year, has held the position for 6 months. I on the other hand, (M, 24) earn 105,000K a year, I've been in my current position for a year. We live in Northern California.

We both recently graduated from university and have a combined $28K in student debt. 5K for me, and 23K for her.

Credit details:

1. Mine (679) During college I went late on a credit card payment 3 times.
2. Hers (685) No late payments, just a small window of credit history

3 ) I paid off my auto loan last month and got a pay for delete collection item removed last month from my credit report.

4) We have no other debt.

Savings:

We have $10,000 in our robinhood which I aim to pull out soon.

We also have $50,000K in a cash low interest savings account.

We have been living rent free for the past year and have managed to save $65,000 (50K for me and about 15K for her) in about 11 months time. As of right now, I am saving 5K a month and she is saving 3K a month.

Around time of purchasing house we should be about 70K in cash savings.

Downpayment:

I think putting 5% down on a 500K house would be $25K plus closing costs of say $10K is reasonable. We should also be comfortable with 6 months of emergency funds.

The issues:

We both have outstanding debt, low employment history and low credit scores. In addition, we plan to buy this house in another state, Colorado, I would have an automatic work transfer to Boulder (I keep the same salary)and she has been interviewing and it seems she could have an offer by the end of this month, she will be increasing her salary by about 20k to 30K.

We are looking to move to Colorado from California, aim is to buy a house around July end (want to see how Covid affects everything) We would work remotely from California prior to move.

Is this realistic?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

1. Big reason on moving: We are both very nature driven, ski a lot, hike extensively with our dog and this would be the ideal area for that. We also plan to do graduate studies (masters) and our field of focus is for me (programming for scientific research) and her (materials engineer) and the boulder/denver area is great for all of the research centers, job opps in our field, as well as CU Boulder for both of our further studies.
2. It's the Arvada area in Colorado, we have family over Longmont, Boulder and Aspen (visited the area (Boulder, Longmont) multiple times in the last year). So yes, we do know the area and more importantly, the area fits our life style quite well. Also, our jobs will most likely be in Boulder, so the commute would be around 20 mins to 50 mins (depending on traffic) on the days we do go into office.
3. Paying off debt: My aim is to pay off the 5K in student debt from a gift from my dad of 2.5k and 2.5k of my own money in the next month or two (it's 0% interest currently and would be good to just get rid of it). As for her, she aims to pay off 5K by next month and wants to pay the rest of over the next year.

,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm trying to figure out how best to invest some monthly recurring income. I've already looked at the flow chart on options, but, still feel unsure, and I just want to hear some people who have been in similar positions. 

About me, 40, 3 kids, divorced, no debt minus house, pay some child support / alimony, have 4 months of emergency funds in high yield savings, doing max contributions to 401k, high earner, generally pretty frugal for day to day life. I'm not going to put money away for kids college at this time, as I am behind on where I think I should be for retirement. 

I'm trying to figure out where I should put these extra funds (1 - 2k /month). 

A really big part of me says, buy real estate. I don't mind the idea of being a land lord. I could see myself doing this full time while unemployed later on in life. I like the idea of building passive income + possibly building equity / wealth with it. I live in a place that is a renters market and will be for some time. But, after this pandemic, and the likelyhood of having to keep leverage on myself with a mortgage to purchase said rental, I'm wondering if that's the right choice. I could likely get into rentals cash only if I wanted to wait 3 or 4 years and find the right deal and kept saving. But, does that equal lost oppurtunity? And given the lack of want to carry a mortgage, the accruing of these assets is a long term thing it feels like. 

OR

Should I say screw it to all those things, and setup a separate brokerage account and start diversifying that way. I'm pretty green to this, and I'm still working on getting my understanding of how to approach this now that I have doubts about my initial plan. Would this be an easy way to do the same things above? Pros/cons? No idea here yet.

OR

Do I pay off the house? I like the appeal of it where I'm only on the hook for taxes, repairs, and living expenses in life. But, I don't need this size house for the rest of my life. My kids will all be adults in 10ish years and hopefully out of the house. I would think I would maybe downsize. So this doesn't seem ideal. And I don't think there is a definitive win or lose in this category to really push me to do it or not other than the emotional debt free want.

,personalfinance,"I don't know if I should post this in r/tooafraidtoask, this sub seems the right place. 

I see a lot of people in this sub talking about loans on credit cards, wondering if they should pay their credit card loan of putting the same money in an account etc. How does that work? It seems very different that how it works where I live in France. 

How it works here : you have a credit card, you spend the money you actually have in your bank account liked to the card. You can be authorised to go under 0€ left in your account but we're talking about 200-500€, if you go above ('under' would be more appropriate) you're paying heavy interests (to prevent you doing it, regular loan's interests being maybe 10 times less), and if it's too often the bank will just take back the credit card or automatically decline payment if your balance isn't sufficient. 

There is no such thing as ""paying credit card loan"", the bank will just prevent you go too deep without asking for your opinion. When you get your salary, if you're balance is negative you can't choose to pay your due to the bank or not, if you're at -500 and getting 200, then you're now at -300, period. 

As a result absolutely everyone has a credit card without much of consumerism problem. Teenagers have a CB that's declined without proper balance, limited in the amount that can be spent/withdrawd per day and per week and per month.

,personalfinance,"Hi All,

I am going to be laid off at the end of June and have about $7k in my 401k. Since we are in a down market and this is a pretty small amount, I figure this would be a good time to roll this over to my Roth IRA. I have cash on hand to pay the taxes next spring, so I am not worried at that. What I am wondering about are some of the nuances related to withdrawal rule. 

Let's say, for this example, I contributed $10k to my roth IRA over the last two years and rolled over $5k. What I understand is I can't touch that $5k for 5 years. I can, however, withdraw my original $10k penalty free. Now let's say the market tanks and my portfolio sinks to a value of $9k. Am I able to withdraw the entire amount as I have contributed $10k, or am I only able to withdraw $4k as $5k would need to be in the account 5 years.

,personalfinance,"Have read too much of others post and thought I'd ask my own. My Wife (F,23) earns roughly $60,000K a year, has held the position for 6 months. I on the other hand, (M, 24) earn 105,000K a year, I've been in my current position for a year. We live in Northern California.

We both recently graduated from university and have a combined $28K in student debt. 5K for me, and 23K for her.

Credit details:

1. Mine (679) During college I went late on a credit card payment 3 times.
2. Hers (685) No late payments, just a small window of credit history

3 ) I paid off my auto loan last month and got a pay for delete collection item removed last month from my credit report.

4) We have no other debt.

Savings:

We have $10,000 in our robinhood which I aim to pull out soon.

We also have $50,000K in a cash low interest savings account.

We have been living rent free for the past year and have managed to save $65,000 (50K for me and about 15K for her) in about 11 months time. As of right now, I am saving 5K a month and she is saving 3K a month.

Around time of purchasing house we should be about 70K in cash savings.

Downpayment:

I think putting 5% down on a 500K house would be $25K plus closing costs of say $10K is reasonable. We should also be comfortable with 6 months of emergency funds.

The issues:

We both have outstanding debt, low employment history and low credit scores. In addition, we plan to buy this house in another state, Colorado, I would have an automatic work transfer to Boulder (I keep the same salary)and she has been interviewing and it seems she could have an offer by the end of this month, she will be increasing her salary by about 20k to 30K.

We are looking to move to Colorado from California, aim is to buy a house around July end (want to see how Covid affects everything) We would work remotely from California prior to move.

Is this realistic?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

1. Big reason on moving: We are both very nature driven, ski a lot, hike extensively with our dog and this would be the ideal area for that. We also plan to do graduate studies (masters) and our field of focus is for me (programming for scientific research) and her (materials engineer) and the boulder/denver area is great for all of the research centers, job opps in our field, as well as CU Boulder for both of our further studies.
2. It's the Arvada area in Colorado, we have family over Longmont, Boulder and Aspen (visited the area (Boulder, Longmont) multiple times in the last year). So yes, we do know the area and more importantly, the area fits our life style quite well. Also, our jobs will most likely be in Boulder, so the commute would be around 20 mins to 50 mins (depending on traffic) on the days we do go into office.
3. Paying off debt: My aim is to pay off the 5K in student debt from a gift from my dad of 2.5k and 2.5k of my own money in the next month or two (it's 0% interest currently and would be good to just get rid of it). As for her, she aims to pay off 5K by next month and wants to pay the rest of over the next year.

I moved here for work / to live with my girlfriend. I currently have a work visa but I am planning to marry my girlfriend anyways so I hope that should allow me to get a greencard along the way.

When the stimulus money came in we put all of it into the monthly payment to shave off more from our principle balance.

My family is just as perplexed. They know just enough English to get by, so they accept that this is just how it works.

,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm trying to figure out how best to invest some monthly recurring income. I've already looked at the flow chart on options, but, still feel unsure, and I just want to hear some people who have been in similar positions. 

About me, 40, 3 kids, divorced, no debt minus house, pay some child support / alimony, have 4 months of emergency funds in high yield savings, doing max contributions to 401k, high earner, generally pretty frugal for day to day life. I'm not going to put money away for kids college at this time, as I am behind on where I think I should be for retirement. 

I'm trying to figure out where I should put these extra funds (1 - 2k /month). 

A really big part of me says, buy real estate. I don't mind the idea of being a land lord. I could see myself doing this full time while unemployed later on in life. I like the idea of building passive income + possibly building equity / wealth with it. I live in a place that is a renters market and will be for some time. But, after this pandemic, and the likelyhood of having to keep leverage on myself with a mortgage to purchase said rental, I'm wondering if that's the right choice. I could likely get into rentals cash only if I wanted to wait 3 or 4 years and find the right deal and kept saving. But, does that equal lost oppurtunity? And given the lack of want to carry a mortgage, the accruing of these assets is a long term thing it feels like. 

OR

Should I say screw it to all those things, and setup a separate brokerage account and start diversifying that way. I'm pretty green to this, and I'm still working on getting my understanding of how to approach this now that I have doubts about my initial plan. Would this be an easy way to do the same things above? Pros/cons? No idea here yet.

OR

Do I pay off the house? I like the appeal of it where I'm only on the hook for taxes, repairs, and living expenses in life. But, I don't need this size house for the rest of my life. My kids will all be adults in 10ish years and hopefully out of the house. I would think I would maybe downsize. So this doesn't seem ideal. And I don't think there is a definitive win or lose in this category to really push me to do it or not other than the emotional debt free want.

I&amp;#39;m pretty green to this, and I&amp;#39;m still working on getting my understanding of how to approach this now that I have doubts about my initial plan. Would this be an easy way to do the same things above? Pros/cons? No idea here yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I pay off the house? I like the appeal of it where I&amp;#39;m only on the hook for taxes, repairs, and living expenses in life. But, I don&amp;#39;t need this size house for the rest of my life. My kids will all be adults in 10ish years and hopefully out of the house. I would think I would maybe downsize. So this doesn&amp;#39;t seem ideal. And I don&amp;#39;t think there is a definitive win or lose in this category to really push me to do it or not other than the emotional debt free want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear anyone&amp;#39;s opinions that can relate, regrets, wins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"I don't know if I should post this in r/tooafraidtoask, this sub seems the right place. 

I see a lot of people in this sub talking about loans on credit cards, wondering if they should pay their credit card loan of putting the same money in an account etc. How does that work? It seems very different that how it works where I live in France. 

How it works here : you have a credit card, you spend the money you actually have in your bank account liked to the card. You can be authorised to go under 0€ left in your account but we're talking about 200-500€, if you go above ('under' would be more appropriate) you're paying heavy interests (to prevent you doing it, regular loan's interests being maybe 10 times less), and if it's too often the bank will just take back the credit card or automatically decline payment if your balance isn't sufficient. 

There is no such thing as ""paying credit card loan"", the bank will just prevent you go too deep without asking for your opinion. When you get your salary, if you're balance is negative you can't choose to pay your due to the bank or not, if you're at -500 and getting 200, then you're now at -300, period. 

As a result absolutely everyone has a credit card without much of consumerism problem. Teenagers have a CB that's declined without proper balance, limited in the amount that can be spent/withdrawd per day and per week and per month.

,personalfinance,"Have read too much of others post and thought I'd ask my own. My Wife (F,23) earns roughly $60,000K a year, has held the position for 6 months. I on the other hand, (M, 24) earn 105,000K a year, I've been in my current position for a year. We live in Northern California.

We both recently graduated from university and have a combined $28K in student debt. 5K for me, and 23K for her.

Credit details:

1. Mine (679) During college I went late on a credit card payment 3 times.
2. Hers (685) No late payments, just a small window of credit history

3 ) I paid off my auto loan last month and got a pay for delete collection item removed last month from my credit report.

4) We have no other debt.

Savings:

We have $10,000 in our robinhood which I aim to pull out soon.

We also have $50,000K in a cash low interest savings account.

We have been living rent free for the past year and have managed to save $65,000 (50K for me and about 15K for her) in about 11 months time. As of right now, I am saving 5K a month and she is saving 3K a month.

Around time of purchasing house we should be about 70K in cash savings.

Downpayment:

I think putting 5% down on a 500K house would be $25K plus closing costs of say $10K is reasonable. We should also be comfortable with 6 months of emergency funds.

The issues:

We both have outstanding debt, low employment history and low credit scores. In addition, we plan to buy this house in another state, Colorado, I would have an automatic work transfer to Boulder (I keep the same salary)and she has been interviewing and it seems she could have an offer by the end of this month, she will be increasing her salary by about 20k to 30K.

We are looking to move to Colorado from California, aim is to buy a house around July end (want to see how Covid affects everything) We would work remotely from California prior to move.

Is this realistic?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

1. Big reason on moving: We are both very nature driven, ski a lot, hike extensively with our dog and this would be the ideal area for that. We also plan to do graduate studies (masters) and our field of focus is for me (programming for scientific research) and her (materials engineer) and the boulder/denver area is great for all of the research centers, job opps in our field, as well as CU Boulder for both of our further studies.
2. It's the Arvada area in Colorado, we have family over Longmont, Boulder and Aspen (visited the area (Boulder, Longmont) multiple times in the last year). So yes, we do know the area and more importantly, the area fits our life style quite well. Also, our jobs will most likely be in Boulder, so the commute would be around 20 mins to 50 mins (depending on traffic) on the days we do go into office.
3. Paying off debt: My aim is to pay off the 5K in student debt from a gift from my dad of 2.5k and 2.5k of my own money in the next month or two (it's 0% interest currently and would be good to just get rid of it). As for her, she aims to pay off 5K by next month and wants to pay the rest of over the next year.

,personalfinance,"Hello there. I recently started working full time and wanted to help my family with their home mortgage.

When the stimulus money came in we put all of it into the monthly payment to shave off more from our principle balance.

I was under the assumption this was a set amount being charged every month for property taxes/insurance, but the amount that automatically went into escrow this month nearly tripled when we paid a larger monthly sum, which was alarming to me. My family is just as perplexed. They know just enough English to get by, so they accept that this is just how it works.

,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm trying to figure out how best to invest some monthly recurring income. I've already looked at the flow chart on options, but, still feel unsure, and I just want to hear some people who have been in similar positions. 

About me, 40, 3 kids, divorced, no debt minus house, pay some child support / alimony, have 4 months of emergency funds in high yield savings, doing max contributions to 401k, high earner, generally pretty frugal for day to day life. I'm not going to put money away for kids college at this time, as I am behind on where I think I should be for retirement. 

I'm trying to figure out where I should put these extra funds (1 - 2k /month). 

A really big part of me says, buy real estate. I don't mind the idea of being a land lord. I could see myself doing this full time while unemployed later on in life. I like the idea of building passive income + possibly building equity / wealth with it. I live in a place that is a renters market and will be for some time. But, after this pandemic, and the likelyhood of having to keep leverage on myself with a mortgage to purchase said rental, I'm wondering if that's the right choice. I could likely get into rentals cash only if I wanted to wait 3 or 4 years and find the right deal and kept saving. But, does that equal lost oppurtunity? And given the lack of want to carry a mortgage, the accruing of these assets is a long term thing it feels like. 

OR

Should I say screw it to all those things, and setup a separate brokerage account and start diversifying that way. I'm pretty green to this, and I'm still working on getting my understanding of how to approach this now that I have doubts about my initial plan. Would this be an easy way to do the same things above? Pros/cons? No idea here yet.

OR

Do I pay off the house? I like the appeal of it where I'm only on the hook for taxes, repairs, and living expenses in life. But, I don't need this size house for the rest of my life. My kids will all be adults in 10ish years and hopefully out of the house. I would think I would maybe downsize. So this doesn't seem ideal.

,personalfinance,"I don't know if I should post this in r/tooafraidtoask, this sub seems the right place. 

I see a lot of people in this sub talking about loans on credit cards, wondering if they should pay their credit card loan of putting the same money in an account etc. How does that work? It seems very different that how it works where I live in France. 

How it works here : you have a credit card, you spend the money you actually have in your bank account liked to the card. You can be authorised to go under 0€ left in your account but we're talking about 200-500€, if you go above ('under' would be more appropriate) you're paying heavy interests (to prevent you doing it, regular loan's interests being maybe 10 times less), and if it's too often the bank will just take back the credit card or automatically decline payment if your balance isn't sufficient. 

There is no such thing as ""paying credit card loan"", the bank will just prevent you go too deep without asking for your opinion. When you get your salary, if you're balance is negative you can't choose to pay your due to the bank or not, if you're at -500 and getting 200, then you're now at -300, period. 

As a result absolutely everyone has a credit card without much of consumerism problem. Teenagers have a CB that's declined without proper balance, limited in the amount that can be spent/withdrawd per day and per week and per month.

,personalfinance,"Have read too much of others post and thought I'd ask my own. My Wife (F,23) earns roughly $60,000K a year, has held the position for 6 months. I on the other hand, (M, 24) earn 105,000K a year, I've been in my current position for a year. We live in Northern California.

We both recently graduated from university and have a combined $28K in student debt. 5K for me, and 23K for her.

Credit details:

1. Mine (679) During college I went late on a credit card payment 3 times.
2. Hers (685) No late payments, just a small window of credit history

3 ) I paid off my auto loan last month and got a pay for delete collection item removed last month from my credit report.

4) We have no other debt.

Savings:

We have $10,000 in our robinhood which I aim to pull out soon.

We also have $50,000K in a cash low interest savings account.

We have been living rent free for the past year and have managed to save $65,000 (50K for me and about 15K for her) in about 11 months time. As of right now, I am saving 5K a month and she is saving 3K a month.

Around time of purchasing house we should be about 70K in cash savings.

Downpayment:

I think putting 5% down on a 500K house would be $25K plus closing costs of say $10K is reasonable. We should also be comfortable with 6 months of emergency funds.

The issues:

We both have outstanding debt, low employment history and low credit scores. In addition, we plan to buy this house in another state, Colorado, I would have an automatic work transfer to Boulder (I keep the same salary)and she has been interviewing and it seems she could have an offer by the end of this month, she will be increasing her salary by about 20k to 30K.

We are looking to move to Colorado from California, aim is to buy a house around July end (want to see how Covid affects everything) We would work remotely from California prior to move.

Is this realistic?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

1. Big reason on moving: We are both very nature driven, ski a lot, hike extensively with our dog and this would be the ideal area for that. We also plan to do graduate studies (masters) and our field of focus is for me (programming for scientific research) and her (materials engineer) and the boulder/denver area is great for all of the research centers, job opps in our field, as well as CU Boulder for both of our further studies.
2. It's the Arvada area in Colorado, we have family over Longmont, Boulder and Aspen (visited the area (Boulder, Longmont) multiple times in the last year). So yes, we do know the area and more importantly, the area fits our life style quite well. Also, our jobs will most likely be in Boulder, so the commute would be around 20 mins to 50 mins (depending on traffic) on the days we do go into office.
3. Paying off debt: My aim is to pay off the 5K in student debt from a gift from my dad of 2.5k and 2.5k of my own money in the next month or two (it's 0% interest currently and would be good to just get rid of it). As for her, she aims to pay off 5K by next month and wants to pay the rest of over the next year.

Why I want to move now: I am really tired of California as is she.

In addition, we plan to buy this house in another state, Colorado, I would have an automatic work transfer to Boulder (I keep the same salary)and she has been interviewing and it seems she could have an offer by the end of this month, she will be increasing her salary by about 20k to 30K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking to move to Colorado from California, aim is to buy a house around July end (want to see how Covid affects everything) We would work remotely from California prior to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this realistic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big reason on moving: We are both very nature driven, ski a lot, hike extensively with our dog and this would be the ideal area for that. We also plan to do graduate studies (masters) and our field of focus is for me (programming for scientific research) and her (materials engineer) and the boulder/denver area is great for all of the research centers, job opps in our field, as well as CU Boulder for both of our further studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s the Arvada area in Colorado, we have family over Longmont, Boulder and Aspen (visited the area (Boulder, Longmont) multiple times in the last year). So yes, we do know the area and more importantly, the area fits our life style quite well. Also, our jobs will most likely be in Boulder, so the commute would be around 20 mins to 50 mins (depending on traffic) on the days we do go into office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying off debt: My aim is to pay off the 5K in student debt from a gift from my dad of 2.5k and 2.5k of my own money in the next month or two (it&amp;#39;s 0% interest currently and would be good to just get rid of it). As for her, she aims to pay off 5K by next month and wants to pay the rest of over the next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I want to move now: I am really tired of California as is she. We also have her family their (who I get along really well with).&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hello there. I recently started working full time and wanted to help my family with their home mortgage.

When the stimulus money came in we put all of it into the monthly payment to shave off more from our principle balance.  There's currently an 8% interest, so a bit goes to that, and then there's the escrow. I was under the assumption this was a set amount being charged every month for property taxes/insurance, but the amount that automatically went into escrow this month nearly tripled when we paid a larger monthly sum, which was alarming to me. My family is just as perplexed. They know just enough English to get by, so they accept that this is just how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? Why does this happen? Thank you in advance for your help.

I recently started working full time and wanted to help my family with their home mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the stimulus money came in we put all of it into the monthly payment to shave off more from our principle balance.  There&amp;#39;s currently an 8% interest, so a bit goes to that, and then there&amp;#39;s the escrow. I was under the assumption this was a set amount being charged every month for property taxes/insurance, but the amount that automatically went into escrow this month nearly tripled when we paid a larger monthly sum, which was alarming to me. My family is just as perplexed. They know just enough English to get by, so they accept that this is just how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal? Why does this happen? Thank you in advance for your help.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm trying to figure out how best to invest some monthly recurring income. I've already looked at the flow chart on options, but, still feel unsure, and I just want to hear some people who have been in similar positions. 

About me, 40, 3 kids, divorced, no debt minus house, pay some child support / alimony, have 4 months of emergency funds in high yield savings, doing max contributions to 401k, high earner, generally pretty frugal for day to day life. I'm not going to put money away for kids college at this time, as I am behind on where I think I should be for retirement. 

I'm trying to figure out where I should put these extra funds (1 - 2k /month). 

A really big part of me says, buy real estate. I don't mind the idea of being a land lord. I could see myself doing this full time while unemployed later on in life. I like the idea of building passive income + possibly building equity / wealth with it. I live in a place that is a renters market and will be for some time. But, after this pandemic, and the likelyhood of having to keep leverage on myself with a mortgage to purchase said rental, I'm wondering if that's the right choice. I could likely get into rentals cash only if I wanted to wait 3 or 4 years and find the right deal and kept saving. But, does that equal lost oppurtunity? And given the lack of want to carry a mortgage, the accruing of these assets is a long term thing it feels like. 

OR

Should I say screw it to all those things, and setup a separate brokerage account and start diversifying that way. I'm pretty green to this, and I'm still working on getting my understanding of how to approach this now that I have doubts about my initial plan. Would this be an easy way to do the same things above? Pros/cons? No idea here yet.

OR

Do I pay off the house? I like the appeal of it where I'm only on the hook for taxes, repairs, and living expenses in life. But, I don't need this size house for the rest of my life. My kids will all be adults in 10ish years and hopefully out of the house. I would think I would maybe downsize. So this doesn't seem ideal.

,personalfinance,"I don't know if I should post this in r/tooafraidtoask, this sub seems the right place. 

I see a lot of people in this sub talking about loans on credit cards, wondering if they should pay their credit card loan of putting the same money in an account etc. How does that work? It seems very different that how it works where I live in France. 

How it works here : you have a credit card, you spend the money you actually have in your bank account liked to the card. You can be authorised to go under 0€ left in your account but we're talking about 200-500€, if you go above ('under' would be more appropriate) you're paying heavy interests (to prevent you doing it, regular loan's interests being maybe 10 times less), and if it's too often the bank will just take back the credit card or automatically decline payment if your balance isn't sufficient. 

There is no such thing as ""paying credit card loan"", the bank will just prevent you go too deep without asking for your opinion. When you get your salary, if you're balance is negative you can't choose to pay your due to the bank or not, if you're at -500 and getting 200, then you're now at -300, period. 

As a result absolutely everyone has a credit card without much of consumerism problem. Teenagers have a CB that's declined without proper balance, limited in the amount that can be spent/withdrawd per day and per week and per month.

,personalfinance,"Hi All,

I am going to be laid off at the end of June and have about $7k in my 401k. Since we are in a down market and this is a pretty small amount, I figure this would be a good time to roll this over to my Roth IRA. I have cash on hand to pay the taxes next spring, so I am not worried at that. What I am wondering about are some of the nuances related to withdrawal rule. 

Let's say, for this example, I contributed $10k to my roth IRA over the last two years and rolled over $5k. What I understand is I can't touch that $5k for 5 years. I can, however, withdraw my original $10k penalty free. Now let's say the market tanks and my portfolio sinks to a value of $9k. Am I able to withdraw the entire amount as I have contributed $10k, or am I only able to withdraw $4k as $5k would need to be in the account 5 years.

I understand that in this make believe scenario it would be foolish to withdraw anything.
